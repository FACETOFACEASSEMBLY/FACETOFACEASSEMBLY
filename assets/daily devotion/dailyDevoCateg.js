  <strong>DO NOT BE AFRAID IN 2026</strong><br><br>

  Fear is not just
  an emotion;
  fear is a spirit,
  and every spirit
  comes with
  an assignment.
  The assignment of fear
  is to torment,
  weaken faith,
  and silence hope.<br><br>

  <strong>1 John 4:18</strong><br>
  “There is no fear in love;
  but perfect love casteth out fear:
  because fear hath torment.”<br><br>

  Today,
  I met a woman
  who said she was afraid —
  afraid she might never
  get pregnant,
  afraid because of her past.
  This is how fear operates:
  it projects the past
  into the future
  and robs people of peace.<br><br>

  The Bible makes it clear
  that fear speaks,
  and fear produces outcomes
  when it is entertained.<br><br>

  <strong>Job 3:25</strong><br>
  “For the thing which I greatly feared
  is come upon me,
  and that which I was afraid of
  is come unto me.”<br><br>

  Job confessed
  that fear had a voice
  in his life.
  Fear opens doors
  to what God
  never ordained.
  That is why fear
  must be confronted
  with the Word of God.<br><br>

  God does not sponsor fear.
  What God gives
  is power to overcome,
  love to heal,
  and a sound mind
  to think correctly.
  Any fear you are carrying
  into 2026
  did not come from God,
  and therefore
  you have authority
  to reject it.<br><br>

  <strong>2 Timothy 1:7</strong><br>
  “For God hath not given us
  the spirit of fear;
  but of power,
  and of love,
  and of a sound mind.”<br><br>

  The Psalmist
  understood this mystery
  when he declared
  fearless confidence
  in God’s presence.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 23:4</strong><br>
  “Yea, though I walk
  through the valley
  of the shadow of death,
  I will fear no evil:
  for thou art with me.”<br><br>

  In this year 2026,
  do not allow fear
  to define your decisions,
  your health,
  your future,
  or your fruitfulness.
  Your past
  cannot cancel
  God’s promises.
  Where fear once spoke,
  let faith now speak.
  Where fear once tormented,
  let peace reign.<br><br>

  Remember,
  fear is a spirit,
  and spirits respond
  to authority.
  When you stand
  on God’s Word,
  fear must bow.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I reject the spirit of fear.
  I receive power,
  love,
  and a sound mind.
  I choose faith over fear,
  peace over torment,
  and truth over lies.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>LEARN TO DO WELL IN 2026</strong><br><br>

  There is always
  a better version of you.
  If only you can learn
  to do well,
  you can become
  a better pastor,
  a better father,
  a better mother,
  a better businessman,
  or even
  a better student.
  This is not a gift;
  it is an act
  of discipline.<br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 1:17</strong><br>
  “Learn to do well;
  seek judgment,
  relieve the oppressed,
  judge the fatherless,
  plead for the widow.”<br><br>

  God spoke to Cain,
  revealing a powerful truth:
  if he had done well,
  his offering
  would have been accepted.<br><br>

  <strong>Genesis 4:7</strong><br>
  “If thou doest well,
  shalt thou not be accepted?
  And if thou doest not well,
  sin lieth at the door.
  And unto thee shall be his desire,
  and thou shalt rule over him.”<br><br>

  When a person
  consistently does well,
  glory follows.
  Reputation is shaped
  by obedience,
  diligence,
  and excellence.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 87:3</strong><br>
  “Glorious things are spoken of thee,
  O city of God.”<br><br>

  Apostle Paul
  requested Mark
  because he had grown
  into usefulness.
  Doing well
  makes you profitable
  in God’s kingdom.<br><br>

  <strong>2 Timothy 4:11</strong><br>
  “Take Mark,
  and bring him with thee:
  for he is profitable to me
  for the ministry.”<br><br>

  Joseph instructed his brothers
  to tell their father
  of his glory in Egypt
  because his life
  had produced visible results.
  Doing well
  cannot be hidden.<br><br>

  <strong>Genesis 45:13</strong><br>
  “And ye shall tell my father
  of all my glory in Egypt,
  and of all that ye have seen.”<br><br>

  You do well
  by embracing truth,
  walking in wisdom,
  accepting instruction,
  and growing in understanding.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 23:23</strong><br>
  “Buy the truth,
  and sell it not;
  also wisdom,
  and instruction,
  and understanding.”<br><br>

  Doing well
  is a deliberate choice.
  It is a lifestyle
  that attracts honor,
  favor,
  and divine acceptance.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  give me the grace
  to do well.
  Let my life
  bring You glory
  and produce excellence
  in all I do.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>A NEW THING, A FRESH PATH</strong><br><br>

  The page has turned.
  The old has passed away,
  and a new year has come.
  This moment is a gift
  from the hand of the Father,
  a fresh path,
  a morning filled with mercy.
  Do not step into it
  carrying the heavy bundles
  of last year’s fears.
  Step into it
  with a heart prepared
  for what God will do.<br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 43:18–19</strong><br>
  “Remember ye not the former things,
  neither consider the things of old.
  Behold, I will do a new thing;
  now it shall spring forth;
  shall ye not know it?
  I will even make a way in the wilderness,
  and rivers in the desert.”<br><br>

  The path ahead is unknown to us.
  We cannot see around its bends.
  But we do not walk it alone,
  and we do not walk it blind.
  We walk with the One
  who is already there.
  He goes before you.
  He levels the mountains
  and bridges the valleys.
  Your assignment
  is not to see the entire journey,
  but to trust the Guide
  for the very next step.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 3:5–6</strong><br>
  “Trust in the LORD with all thine heart;
  and lean not unto thine own understanding.
  In all thy ways acknowledge Him,
  and He shall direct thy paths.”<br><br>

  On this first day of the year,
  let us set our hearts.
  Let us plant our feet
  on this new path
  with holy expectation.
  In your spirit,
  speak one hope for 2026:<br><br>

  · One area where you will trust Him more.<br>
  · One habit you will ask Him to help you build.<br>
  · One person you will intentionally show His love to.<br>
  · One promise from His Word you will stand upon.<br><br>

  This act of expectation
  is an act of faith.
  It declares,
  “My God, I believe You are good.
  I believe Your plans for me are good.
  I am ready to follow.
  Help me.”<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I stand at the beginning of this new year
  with thanksgiving and with faith.
  You have been faithful,
  and You will remain faithful.
  I choose to trust You
  with all that lies ahead.
  Guide my steps.
  Order my path.
  My eyes are fixed on You.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.<br><br>

  May the Lord bless you in this new year.
  May you walk daily
  in His fresh mercies,
  His clear direction,
  and His unfailing grace.
  Welcome to 2026.
