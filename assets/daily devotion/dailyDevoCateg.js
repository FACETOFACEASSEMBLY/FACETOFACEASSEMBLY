<strong>RESIST THE DEVIL</strong><br><br>

<strong>James 4:7</strong><br>
“Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”<br><br>

The command to resist is a declaration of spiritual authority granted to the believer. It is not a suggestion, but a sovereign strategy for victory. Notice the divine order: first, full submission to God. Submission aligns us under His rule and places us within the covering of His authority.<br><br>

The enemy’s tactics are consistent, accusation, deception, temptation, and intimidation. But his power was broken at the cross. When you resist him from your position in Christ, you are not fighting for victory, you are enforcing the victory already won by Jesus.<br><br>

Do not be dismayed by his persistence or the roar of his threats. Your stand is not in your own strength, but in the might of the King you serve. Just as a soldier stands firm not by personal power but by the authority of the nation he represents, you stand in the authority of the name of Jesus.<br><br>

The promise is clear. It does not say he *may* flee. It says he *will* flee. Your consistent, faith-filled resistance activates his compulsory retreat. When you submit to God and stand your ground in truth, the enemy has no option but to withdraw.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I submit every area of my heart, mind, and life to You. I take my stand in the authority of Christ, and I resist the devil. I declare that every work of darkness flees from my life, my home, and my destiny. I walk in victory through Jesus’ name. Amen.

<strong>THE GOD WHO SHUTS THE MOUTH OF LIONS</strong><br><br>

<strong>Daniel 6:22</strong><br>
“My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me.”<br><br>

The testimony of Daniel is a mighty proclamation of God’s deliverance. Thrown into a den of hungry lions for his faithfulness, he spent the night with them, untouched. Why? Because the Living God sent His angel to shut their mouths. God did not remove Daniel from the den, but He rendered the lions powerless within the den.<br><br>

That same power is alive today. The God of Daniel is your God. The enemies that roar against you, whether people, circumstances, accusations, or fears, have a mouth that can be shut. Their ability to harm you, intimidate you, or devour your peace and destiny can be divinely neutralized by the command of Heaven.<br><br>

Do not be terrified by the roaring. The lions roared all night around Daniel, yet he was preserved. Your faith in the Living God is your safe place. Your consistent prayer life and unwavering commitment to God, like Daniel’s, activate angelic intervention and the silencing power of God.<br><br>

Stand firm in faith and decree it boldly: The same power that shut the mouths of lions will shut the mouth of every enemy speaking against my life, my family, my purpose, and my peace. This victory is not by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, the Deliverer of Daniel, I thank You for Your mighty power. I declare that the same angelic ministry that shut the lions’ mouths is active on my behalf today. In the mighty name of Jesus, I command every roaring mouth of the enemy against my life to be shut, silenced, and rendered powerless. I walk in divine protection and peace, for my life is hid in Christ. Amen.

<strong>OH LORD, MAKE ME TO WALK ON HIGH PLACES THIS YEAR</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 18:33</strong><br>
“He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.”<br><br>

There are some people who seem to move through life on a different level. They are lifted from one place of authority to another, finding favour and responsibility wherever they go. They are not destroyed by pits or prisons, but are carried above them. This is what it means to walk on the high places of life.<br><br>

Think of Joseph. From his father’s house, he was given a coat of honour. When he arrived in Potiphar’s house, he was made head above everyone, even in a strange land. In the prison, he was placed in charge. He was not merely surviving the low places; he was being prepared to rule in higher places. His journey from the prison to the palace reveals God’s power to elevate a life at the appointed time.<br><br>

Walking on high places is not about pride. It is about divine promotion. It is God’s grace positioning you where your gifts can serve His purpose. It is having a higher perspective above your problems and authority over your challenges. It is living in the fulfillment of God’s plan for your life.<br><br>

In this year 2026, do not settle for the valley. Do not accept fear, limitation, or lack as your permanent address. The same God who set Joseph upon his high place desires to set your feet upon yours. It begins with trusting Him in the low place, serving faithfully, and believing in the promise of elevation.<br><br>

Ask Him today. Cry out with faith and expectation: “Oh Lord, make me to walk on the high places of life this year.” Believe that He will steady your steps, make your path clear, and lead you into the places of influence and purpose He has prepared for you.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I ask for divine elevation in this year 2026. As You did for Joseph, set my feet upon high places. Take me from where I am to where You have destined me to be. Let Your favour lift me into new levels of authority and service for Your glory. Make my path clear and my feet sure. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.
