  <strong>MY GATE SHALL BE OPEN CONTINUALLY THIS YEAR 2026</strong><br><br>

  A gate is not just
  an entrance;
  it is a place of access,
  control,
  and opportunity.
  When a gate is shut,
  purpose is delayed
  and provision is blocked.
  But an open gate means favor,
  passage,
  and the unimpeded flow
  of God’s goodness.<br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 60:11</strong><br>
  “Therefore thy gates
  shall be open continually;
  they shall not be shut
  day nor night,
  that men may bring unto thee
  the forces of the Gentiles,
  and that their kings
  may be brought.”<br><br>

  God is intentional
  about open gates.
  He does not open them
  occasionally,
  he opens them continually.<br><br>

  <strong>Revelation 3:8</strong><br>
  “I know thy works:
  behold, I have set before thee
  an open door,
  and no man can shut it:
  for thou hast a little strength,
  and hast kept my word,
  and hast not denied my name.”<br><br>

  What God opens,
  no system,
  no past failure,
  no earthly power
  can close.
  God does not sponsor
  closed doors to destiny.
  What he provides
  is access,
  divine connections,
  and seasons of ingathering.
  Any thought that says
  “it is too late”
  or “it is impossible”
  did not come from him,
  and therefore
  you have authority
  to reject it.<br><br>

  The Psalmist
  understood this mystery
  when he declared
  prophetic authority
  over gates and doors.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 24:7</strong><br>
  “Lift up your heads,
  O ye gates;
  and be ye lift up,
  ye everlasting doors;
  and the King of glory
  shall come in.”<br><br>

  In this year 2026,
  do not accept
  the report of closed doors.
  Your past rejections
  cannot veto
  God’s decree
  of open access.
  Where you once saw a wall,
  see a gate.
  Where you once met delay,
  expect divine traffic —
  ideas,
  helpers,
  resources,
  and favor
  flowing toward you.
  Your gate is open
  continually,
  not occasionally,
  not seasonally,
  but continually.<br><br>

  Remember,
  a decree
  is a spiritual force.
  When you stand
  on God’s Word,
  circumstances must align
  with his promise.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  let my gates
  be open continually
  this year 2026.
  Let access replace delay,
  favor replace resistance,
  and progress replace stagnation.
  I agree with your Word,
  in Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>DO NOT BE AFRAID IN 2026</strong><br><br>

  Fear is not just
  an emotion;
  fear is a spirit,
  and every spirit
  comes with
  an assignment.
  The assignment of fear
  is to torment,
  weaken faith,
  and silence hope.<br><br>

  <strong>1 John 4:18</strong><br>
  “There is no fear in love;
  but perfect love casteth out fear:
  because fear hath torment.”<br><br>

  Today,
  I met a woman
  who said she was afraid —
  afraid she might never
  get pregnant,
  afraid because of her past.
  This is how fear operates:
  it projects the past
  into the future
  and robs people of peace.<br><br>

  The Bible makes it clear
  that fear speaks,
  and fear produces outcomes
  when it is entertained.<br><br>

  <strong>Job 3:25</strong><br>
  “For the thing which I greatly feared
  is come upon me,
  and that which I was afraid of
  is come unto me.”<br><br>

  Job confessed
  that fear had a voice
  in his life.
  Fear opens doors
  to what God
  never ordained.
  That is why fear
  must be confronted
  with the Word of God.<br><br>

  God does not sponsor fear.
  What God gives
  is power to overcome,
  love to heal,
  and a sound mind
  to think correctly.
  Any fear you are carrying
  into 2026
  did not come from God,
  and therefore
  you have authority
  to reject it.<br><br>

  <strong>2 Timothy 1:7</strong><br>
  “For God hath not given us
  the spirit of fear;
  but of power,
  and of love,
  and of a sound mind.”<br><br>

  The Psalmist
  understood this mystery
  when he declared
  fearless confidence
  in God’s presence.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 23:4</strong><br>
  “Yea, though I walk
  through the valley
  of the shadow of death,
  I will fear no evil:
  for thou art with me.”<br><br>

  In this year 2026,
  do not allow fear
  to define your decisions,
  your health,
  your future,
  or your fruitfulness.
  Your past
  cannot cancel
  God’s promises.
  Where fear once spoke,
  let faith now speak.
  Where fear once tormented,
  let peace reign.<br><br>

  Remember,
  fear is a spirit,
  and spirits respond
  to authority.
  When you stand
  on God’s Word,
  fear must bow.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I reject the spirit of fear.
  I receive power,
  love,
  and a sound mind.
  I choose faith over fear,
  peace over torment,
  and truth over lies.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>LEARN TO DO WELL IN 2026</strong><br><br>

  There is always
  a better version of you.
  If only you can learn
  to do well,
  you can become
  a better pastor,
  a better father,
  a better mother,
  a better businessman,
  or even
  a better student.
  This is not a gift;
  it is an act
  of discipline.<br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 1:17</strong><br>
  “Learn to do well;
  seek judgment,
  relieve the oppressed,
  judge the fatherless,
  plead for the widow.”<br><br>

  God spoke to Cain,
  revealing a powerful truth:
  if he had done well,
  his offering
  would have been accepted.<br><br>

  <strong>Genesis 4:7</strong><br>
  “If thou doest well,
  shalt thou not be accepted?
  And if thou doest not well,
  sin lieth at the door.
  And unto thee shall be his desire,
  and thou shalt rule over him.”<br><br>

  When a person
  consistently does well,
  glory follows.
  Reputation is shaped
  by obedience,
  diligence,
  and excellence.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 87:3</strong><br>
  “Glorious things are spoken of thee,
  O city of God.”<br><br>

  Apostle Paul
  requested Mark
  because he had grown
  into usefulness.
  Doing well
  makes you profitable
  in God’s kingdom.<br><br>

  <strong>2 Timothy 4:11</strong><br>
  “Take Mark,
  and bring him with thee:
  for he is profitable to me
  for the ministry.”<br><br>

  Joseph instructed his brothers
  to tell their father
  of his glory in Egypt
  because his life
  had produced visible results.
  Doing well
  cannot be hidden.<br><br>

  <strong>Genesis 45:13</strong><br>
  “And ye shall tell my father
  of all my glory in Egypt,
  and of all that ye have seen.”<br><br>

  You do well
  by embracing truth,
  walking in wisdom,
  accepting instruction,
  and growing in understanding.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 23:23</strong><br>
  “Buy the truth,
  and sell it not;
  also wisdom,
  and instruction,
  and understanding.”<br><br>

  Doing well
  is a deliberate choice.
  It is a lifestyle
  that attracts honor,
  favor,
  and divine acceptance.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  give me the grace
  to do well.
  Let my life
  bring You glory
  and produce excellence
  in all I do.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.
