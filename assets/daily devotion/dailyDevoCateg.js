  <strong>OH LORD, LET THE WICKEDNESS OF THE WICKED COME TO AN END</strong><br><br>

  There is a divine justice system woven into the foundations of God’s kingdom. Scripture shows us that wickedness is never permitted to continue unchecked. There is a point where the mercy of God steps aside, and His righteous judgment steps in.<br><br>

  David understood this mystery. Surrounded by enemies whose hearts were hardened against righteousness, he cried not for revenge, but for alignment with God’s divine order.<br><br>

  “Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.”<br>
  <em>— Psalm 7:9</em><br><br>

  The wickedness of the wicked is not just an act — it is a system, a pattern, a destructive cycle that seeks to ruin destinies, families, and purposes.<br><br>

  Yet throughout Scripture, God rises to interrupt wicked cycles. In the days of Mordecai and Esther, when Haman crafted evil, the Lord overturned the device of the wicked.<br><br>

  “So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.”<br>
  <em>— Esther 7:10</em><br><br>

  Wickedness may appear strong, but it has an expiry date in God’s calendar. And divine justice never destroys wickedness without uplifting righteousness in its place.<br><br>

  “For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.”<br>
  <em>— Psalm 37:17</em><br><br>

  When you pray, “Oh Lord, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,” you are declaring a verdict already written in heaven.<br><br>

  <em>Proverbs 4:14–16</em><br>
  14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.<br>
  15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.<br>
  16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.<br><br>

  Hear this today: the wickedness of the wicked must come to an end, and the righteousness of the righteous must be established.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  Oh Lord, let every form of wickedness assigned against my life come to an end. Establish Your righteousness in me, around me, and through me. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>A THREEFOLD CORD</strong><br><br>

  There is a divine pattern hidden in the principle of “three times.” In Scripture, consistent spiritual actions repeated three times often carry prophetic weight and power.<br><br>

  When Jesus faced the weight of the cross, He prayed three times about the same matter. This was not mere repetition; it was persistence in surrender. And after the third time, He said, “Not my will, but Thine be done.”<br>
  <em>— Matthew 26:44</em><br><br>

  Daniel also followed this ancient pattern. Even in the face of persecution, he remained unshaken, praying three times a day with his windows open toward Jerusalem.<br>
  <em>— Daniel 6:10</em><br><br>

  The Psalmist echoed the same rhythm of devotion: evening, morning, and noon — a complete cycle of spiritual discipline.<br>
  <em>— Psalm 55:17</em><br><br>

  Why three times? Because heaven recognizes “three” as a complete witness — a divine confirmation.<br>
  <em>— 2 Corinthians 13:1</em><br><br>

  Even creation itself mirrors this divine pattern: Heaven, Earth, and Under the Earth — all bowing to the name of Jesus.<br>
  <em>— Philippians 2:10</em><br><br>

  And when you face a pressing issue, Scripture shows another mystery: agreement. Find two people who will stand with you in faith, for a threefold cord cannot be easily broken.<br>
  <em>— Ecclesiastes 4:12</em><br><br>

  There is power in spiritual consistency. Whatever area you desire to see results — prayer, fasting, giving, declarations — commit to it three times, and watch heaven respond with power.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  Father, strengthen my commitment to spiritual consistency. Help me to build a threefold cord of discipline, faith, and agreement, and let heaven respond to my persistence. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.

  <strong>YOUR MOURNING WILL TURN TO DANCING</strong><br><br>

  “You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; You have put off my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness.”<br>
  <em>— Psalm 30:11</em><br><br>

  I will never forget the day a woman came to me, her body shaking with violent sobs. Her son had been kidnapped.
  The pain was so deep she could barely speak. Her lamentation came from a place of utter despair.<br><br>

  She fell to her knees, and all she could cry was, “My son, my son!” The situation looked impossible,
  the darkness overwhelming.<br><br>

  But in that very moment, the Spirit of God rose within me. I looked at her and declared a word from the Lord:
  “Go to the altar now and pour out your heart before God. But hear this — the same God who delivered Daniel
  from the lions’ den and the three Hebrew boys from the fiery furnace is alive today. He will do it for you.
  God will turn your mourning and your pain into dancing.”<br><br>

  It was a prophecy spoken into the middle of deep pain.<br><br>

  A few days later, I heard a commotion outside. It was her — but this time she was not crying.
  She was shouting, “Pastor! Pastor!” with a voice full of joy. She ran to me, her face shining,
  and right there she began to dance!<br><br>

  She testified, “They have released my son! He is free! God has done it!”<br><br>

  The same woman who was clothed with the sackcloth of mourning was now clothed with the gladness of victory.
  God had turned her wailing into a dance of joy.<br><br>

  Hear me today: whatever that mourning represents in your life — sickness, financial debt, a broken marriage,
  a wayward child — the God of Psalm 30:11 has not changed.<br><br>

  Your situation is not too hard for Him. Just as He turned that woman’s sorrow into celebration,
  He will turn yours too. Your crying season is ending, and your dancing season is beginning. Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, My God, turn every pain in my heart into joy. In Jesus' Name, Amen.
