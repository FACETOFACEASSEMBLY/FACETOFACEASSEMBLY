  <strong>FAITHFUL GOD, WE THANK YOU</strong><br><br>

  We are on the last page of the 2025 calendar.
  We stand in the sacred space
  between what has been
  and what will be.
  Before we cross over,
  we pause.
  We do not rush ahead.
  Instead, we look back,
  not with regret,
  but with recognition,
  searching for the footprints of God
  in the soil of the past twelve months.<br><br>

  <strong>Luke 17:14–19</strong><br><br>

  The year 2025 carried its own story.
  There were chapters of brilliant joy
  and paragraphs of profound difficulty.
  There were days that felt light and easy,
  and nights that felt long and heavy.<br><br>

  Yet even the hard ground of 2025
  was watered by His faithful care.
  God was sowing seeds
  in winters you could not see.
  He was building strength in the struggle.
  He was teaching your heart
  to trust His hand in the darkness.
  Every single morning,
  His mercy met you.<br><br>

  <strong>Lamentations 3:22–23</strong><br>
  “It is of the Lord’s mercies that we are not consumed,
  because His compassions fail not.
  They are new every morning:
  great is Thy faithfulness.”<br><br>

  On this final day of the year,
  offer a deliberate thanksgiving.
  In your heart,
  name one thing from 2025:<br><br>

  · One way He provided.<br>
  · One moment He gave you peace.<br>
  · One way you grew.<br>
  · One person He sent.<br>
  · One promise that held you.<br><br>

  To name them
  is to worship.
  It is to say,
  “I see Your goodness, Lord.
  I acknowledge it.
  I thank You for it.”<br><br>

  Gratitude seals the year
  and positions the heart for the next.
  As you step forward,
  do so with a thankful spirit,
  knowing the same faithful God
  who carried you through 2025
  has already gone ahead of you
  into 2026.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  all I have to say is
  thank You, Lord.
  For life, for mercy,
  for strength, and for grace.
  I enter the new season
  with a grateful heart.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>RIGHT THINKING</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Luke 1:28–37</strong><br>
  “And the angel came in unto Mary, and said,
  Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee:
  blessed art thou among women.<br><br>

  And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,
  and bring forth a son,
  and shalt call his name JESUS.<br><br>

  Then said Mary unto the angel,
  How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?<br><br>

  And the angel answered and said unto her,
  The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
  and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee:
  therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
  shall be called the Son of God.<br><br>

  And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth,
  she hath also conceived a son in her old age:
  and this is the sixth month with her,
  who was called barren.<br><br>

  For with God nothing shall be impossible.”<br><br>

  Immediately, Mary’s thinking changed.
  She moved from questioning
  to submission,
  from limitation
  to alignment.
  And she declared,
  <strong>“Be it unto me according to thy word.”</strong><br><br>

  Right thinking positions a man
  for divine manifestation.
  Until your thinking changes,
  your outcome remains the same.<br><br>

  The prodigal son also experienced
  a shift in thinking.
  First, he demanded his inheritance.
  Later, after losing everything,
  he thought again and said,
  “I will arise and go to my father.”
  That single thought
  restored his destiny.<br><br>

  <strong>Ephesians 3:20</strong><br>
  God is able to do exceedingly abundantly
  above all that we ask or think.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 23:7</strong><br>
  “For as a man thinketh in his heart,
  so is he.”<br><br>

  Your life will always move
  in the direction of your dominant thoughts.
  Think rightly,
  align your mind with God’s Word,
  and become a better version of yourself.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  align my thoughts with Your Word.
  Remove every limitation in my mind,
  and let my thinking produce Your will
  in my life.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>JOY IS COMING</strong><br><br>

  Everyone desires joy.
  Everyone wants a heart full of gladness,
  a life that overflows with laughter and peace,
  no matter the season.<br><br>

  The Lord Himself is the giver of joy.
  He hears the prayers of your heart
  and answers in ways that fill your mouth with laughter
  and your spirit with delight.
  Just as He visited Zacharias,
  He will visit you with the assurance
  that your appointed joy is on the way.<br><br>

  <strong>Luke 1:13–14</strong><br><br>

  <strong>John 15:11</strong><br>
  “These things have I spoken unto you,
  that my joy might remain in you,
  and that your joy might be full.”<br><br>

  The Scripture also declares:<br>
  <strong>Isaiah 12:3</strong><br>
  “Therefore with joy shall ye draw water
  out of the wells of salvation.”<br><br>

  However, joy can be stolen.
  The Bible shows us that when joy withers,
  everything else begins to languish.<br>
  <strong>Joel 1:12</strong><br><br>

  You must guard your joy.
  Avoid anyone
  and any situation
  that drains your joy.
  Protect the well within you.<br><br>

  No one accidentally lives a joyful life
  in a sorrowful world.
  But as you fix your heart
  on the Father of lights,
  I declare today:
  <strong>Your joy is coming!</strong><br><br>

  God is restoring every lost celebration,
  filling your mouth with laughter,
  and causing your well to overflow.
  Your heart shall be light,
  and your days shall be glad,
  in Jesus’ Name.
  Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  restore my joy this day.
  Let every stolen gladness return,
  and let my heart overflow with Your joy.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.
