  <strong>I AM A MAN UNDER AUTHORITY</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Matthew 8:6-9</strong><br>
  “Lord, my servant lies at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.” And Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.” The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”<br><br>

  Today, we step deeper into our Season of Alleluia by unlocking a profound mystery — the mystery of divine authority. Our shout of “Alleluia” is not only in gratitude for what God has done, but in recognition of the position He has given us to enforce His will on earth.<br><br>

  The centurion’s faith astonished Jesus because he understood the principle of delegated authority. He said, “I am a man under authority.” His ability to command came from the power he was submitted to. Because he was under authority, he could speak with authority.<br><br>

  Beloved, this is your kingdom identity. You are not ordinary, and you are not operating alone. You are a man, a woman, UNDER AUTHORITY — the supreme authority of Jesus Christ. And because you are under His Lordship, His authority flows through you. You speak in the power of His name.<br><br>

  Scripture declares: “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God…” (John 1:12). As a child of God, you carry divine authority. Jesus entrusted you with power over all devils (Luke 9:1) and with the ability to command mountains to move (Mark 11:23).<br><br>

  Just as Jesus stood at the tomb of Lazarus and issued a command (John 11:43), you also have been empowered to speak to situations in His name:<br><br>

  · You can call FORTH favor, connections, and prosperity, and they must come.<br>
  · You can command TO GO sickness, poverty, shame, and oppression, and they must flee.<br><br>

  Your words are not empty. When aligned with God’s Word, they become spiritual mandates. Heaven backs them. Angels respond to them. Darkness fears them. The centurion knew that authority makes words powerful — and when you speak in the name of Jesus, all of heaven enforces your declaration.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father My God, I declare that I am a man under Your authority. Today, I call forth my inheritance of health, prosperity, favor, and peace. I command every force of lack, sickness, and shame to depart from my life and my household. My “Alleluia” is the shout of a victorious soldier in Your army. As I have believed, so let it be unto me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

  <strong>WELCOME TO THE SEASON OF ALLELUIA</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Revelation 19:1-2, 6</strong><br>
  “And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: For true and righteous are his judgments... And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.”<br><br>

  Today, I welcome you into a divine moment — the <strong>Season of Alleluia</strong>. This is a holy time of gratitude, a spiritual pause where you look back from January until now and recognize the countless ways God has carried you, protected you, restored you, provided for you, and shown you mercy.<br><br>

  That word “Alleluia” is not ordinary. In Revelation 19, it is the roaring shout of heaven — the sound of victory, fulfilment, and overwhelming gratitude. Heaven shouts “Alleluia!” because every promise God made, He kept. Every word He spoke, He performed.<br><br>

  Your life this year echoes that same testimony. The difficult days you survived, the blessings you received unexpectedly, the dangers you escaped, the provisions that came right on time — these are not coincidences. They are the fingerprints of a faithful God. Each moment is a reminder that God does not fail (Numbers 23:19).<br><br>

  As you look back, your heart begins to swell with thanksgiving. That fullness of gratitude demands expression, and that expression is your “Alleluia!” It is your agreement with heaven that God has been good to you, powerful in your life, and consistent in His love.<br><br>

  The Psalmist said, “He has given me a new song to sing, a song of praise to our God” (Psalm 40:3). This season, your new song is simple but mighty: <strong>ALLELUIA!</strong> It is your shout of appreciation to the God who has carried you from the beginning of the year till now.<br><br>

  Do not hold it back. Let your Alleluia rise from a heart that has seen the faithfulness of God. Let it be a testimony, a declaration, and a celebration of the One who reigns forever.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father My God, I thank You for this Season of Alleluia. As I look back on this year, I see Your hand in every moment. I acknowledge Your faithfulness, Your mercy, and Your unfailing love. Today, I lift my voice with the hosts of heaven and declare: ALLELUIA! Let Your goodness continue in my life, and let Your glory be revealed in all that concerns me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

  <strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL BY TEACHER OF GOD'S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

  <strong>FRIDAY, 5TH DECEMBER 2025</strong><br><br>

  <strong>THE POWER OF AGREEMENT</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Matthew 18:19</strong><br>
  “Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.”<br><br>

  When God looked upon the people at Babel, He saw a formidable force. Their unity of language and purpose created a power so potent that Heaven itself declared that nothing would be restrained from them. This is the divine principle of agreement. It is not merely about human coordination; it is a spiritual key that unlocks heavenly action.<br><br>

  At creation, the Godhead said, “Let us make man,” and in that sacred agreement, humanity was formed (Genesis 1:26).<br><br>

  In the face of death, a wife can stand in agreement with Heaven for her husband's life. In the face of lack, friends can agree for breakthrough. This power is not a mystery kept from you; it is a key placed in your hands. Jesus Christ Himself affirmed it: “Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them...” (Matthew 18:19). The condition is clear: a united heart and a common purpose can birth greatness.<br><br>

  This is a call to action. Identify that God-fearing person who shares your spirit, who truly desires your prosperity and God's glory in your life. Approach them. Share your heart’s petition. Pray together. Agree together. For when covenant people come into agreement on God’s Word, they create a spiritual atmosphere where miracles are birthed.<br><br>

  Do not bear that burden alone. Do not fight that battle in isolation. The God who is present where two or three are gathered is waiting to confirm His Word in your midst. As you step out in faith to seek agreement, you activate a divine law. Heaven records it, and angels are dispatched to work on your behalf in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father My God, I thank You for revealing the power of agreement. Today, I receive the wisdom and the divine connection to find a covenant partner in prayer. As we agree according to Your will, I declare that every mountain is removed, every chain is broken, and every promise is fulfilled in my life. Let Your hand move mightily in all that concerns me. I shall testify to Your goodness, in Jesus’ Name, Amen.
</p>
