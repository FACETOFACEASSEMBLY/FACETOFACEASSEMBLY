<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD'S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

<strong>FRIDAY 30TH JANUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>FORGIVEN AND FREE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Daniel 9:9</strong><br>
“To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him.”<br><br>

Every one of us has fallen short of God’s glory. No one is perfect. Yet, the beauty of walking with God is this: He does not delight in condemning us, but in forgiving us. His mercy is greater than our mistakes.<br><br>

<strong>Psalm 130:4</strong> tells us that forgiveness is not just a benefit, it is part of God’s nature. He forgives so that we may reverence him, draw near to him, and live in freedom.<br><br>

Many struggle with guilt, shame, and the fear that God is angry with them. But <strong>1 John 1:9</strong> is a promise we can hold onto. If we come to him with sincerity and confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive and cleanse us completely. Not partially — completely.<br><br>

Even when we rebel, God's heart remains open to forgive us.<br><br>

“To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses…”<br>
He is more ready to forgive than we are to ask.<br><br>

Are you carrying guilt from past mistakes?<br><br>

Do you feel distant from God because of something you've done?<br><br>

Today, come boldly to him. Don’t hide — confess, believe, and receive. God is not looking to condemn you; he is waiting to restore you.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, I come boldly today. Show me and my entire family mercy. Amen.

<strong>WHO IS A CHRISTIAN?</strong><br><br>

<strong>Acts 11:26</strong><br>
“And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.”<br><br>

Many people today claim to be Christians, but few truly understand what the word means. A few days ago, I asked a young man who a Christian is, and he said, “A Christian is a person that follows God and eschews evil.” While that answer sounds right, it is incomplete.<br><br>

The truth is this: a Christian is a person who follows Jesus Christ. A Christian is one who believes in the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>

Many people follow God. The Jews follow God. Muslims follow God. Many religions believe in God. But what separates a Christian from others is Jesus. They will never agree with you on Jesus, but Christianity stands or falls on Him.<br><br>

The Bible says in Acts 11:26 that the disciples were called Christians. They did not name themselves. People watched their lives, studied their conduct, and saw their character, and then called them Christians. Their character revealed Christ.<br><br>

This teaches us a deep truth: your character matters. You are not a Christian because you attend church. You are called a Christian when your life looks like Christ.<br><br>

In Galatians 5:1, the Scripture says, “Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free…” A Christian is already delivered from bondage through Christ. Sin, darkness, and the flesh no longer have dominion. But that freedom must show evidence.<br><br>

In Galatians 5:22–23, the Bible reveals the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance. These fruits are the proof of a Christian life.<br><br>

A Christian must not walk in darkness. A Christian must walk in the light of Christ.<br><br>

The Bible says, “Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith” (Hebrews 12:2). Jesus is not only the beginning of our faith, He is also the standard. When we look unto Him, our lives are shaped to reflect Him.<br><br>

Christianity is not just confession; it is transformation. Not just belief, but becoming like Christ.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, help me to follow Jesus truly. Let my character reflect Christ. I look unto Jesus, the author and finisher of my faith, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
