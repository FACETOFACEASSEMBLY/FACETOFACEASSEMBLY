  <strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL BY TEACHER OF GOD'S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

  <strong>FRIDAY, 5TH DECEMBER 2025</strong><br><br>

  <strong>THE POWER OF AGREEMENT</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Matthew 18:19</strong><br>
  “Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.”<br><br>

  When God looked upon the people at Babel, He saw a formidable force. Their unity of language and purpose created a power so potent that Heaven itself declared that nothing would be restrained from them. This is the divine principle of agreement. It is not merely about human coordination; it is a spiritual key that unlocks heavenly action.<br><br>

  At creation, the Godhead said, “Let us make man,” and in that sacred agreement, humanity was formed (Genesis 1:26).<br><br>

  In the face of death, a wife can stand in agreement with Heaven for her husband's life. In the face of lack, friends can agree for breakthrough. This power is not a mystery kept from you; it is a key placed in your hands. Jesus Christ Himself affirmed it: “Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them...” (Matthew 18:19). The condition is clear: a united heart and a common purpose can birth greatness.<br><br>

  This is a call to action. Identify that God-fearing person who shares your spirit, who truly desires your prosperity and God's glory in your life. Approach them. Share your heart’s petition. Pray together. Agree together. For when covenant people come into agreement on God’s Word, they create a spiritual atmosphere where miracles are birthed.<br><br>

  Do not bear that burden alone. Do not fight that battle in isolation. The God who is present where two or three are gathered is waiting to confirm His Word in your midst. As you step out in faith to seek agreement, you activate a divine law. Heaven records it, and angels are dispatched to work on your behalf in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father My God, I thank You for revealing the power of agreement. Today, I receive the wisdom and the divine connection to find a covenant partner in prayer. As we agree according to Your will, I declare that every mountain is removed, every chain is broken, and every promise is fulfilled in my life. Let Your hand move mightily in all that concerns me. I shall testify to Your goodness, in Jesus’ Name, Amen.

<strong>FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END, HE IS GOD</strong><br><br>

“I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.”<br>
<em>— Revelation 1:8</em><br><br>

Many began this year with joy, yet fear now whispers, “Will you see the end? Will you finish in pain?” To every weary soul, the Lord Himself declares: I am Alpha — your beginning, and Omega — your ending. Your year, your life, your assignment is held between His eternal hands. The God who started your journey is the same God who has already been where you are going. He does not just observe time — He owns it.<br><br>

Some start well but do not finish well. But for you who are in Christ, your ending is not written by fear; it is written by God. The Almighty who walked with you in January is already waiting for you in December. Therefore, do not fear how this year will end. Do not fear how any God-ordained task will end.<br><br>

“A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.”<br>
<em>— Deuteronomy 11:12</em><br><br>

Just as God watched over the promised land, His eyes are continually upon you and upon every good thing He has entrusted to you — from the first day of the year to the very last. You are the land He cares for.<br><br>

“I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.”<br>
<em>— 2 Timothy 4:7</em><br><br>

Apostle Paul finished with joy because he knew the Alpha and Omega was with him, watching over his course from start to finish. The Lord who helped him begin helped him end. So shall it be for you. If God started it with you, He will finish it with you. You will not end in tears; you will end in His faithfulness, under His watchful care from beginning to end.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I thank You because Your eyes are upon me from the beginning of the year even unto the end. I place every fear concerning this year’s ending into Your hands. I declare that what You have begun in me, You will bring to a good and perfect end. Help me finish with joy, holding fast to my faith in Jesus Christ. Amen.

<strong>NO EVIL SHALL BEFALL THEE</strong><br><br>

“There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.”<br>
<em>— Proverbs 12:21</em><br><br>

As we continue in this blessed month, the Lord speaks a sure word of covering over your life. In a world filled with fear and hidden dangers, God has declared a fixed, unshakable promise concerning the righteous. You are not exposed to the traps of the enemy. The Lord Himself has decreed that evil shall not be your portion.<br><br>

“There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.”<br>
<em>— Psalm 91:10–11</em><br><br>

No weapon of eternal harm, no condemning verdict, no destructive power of the wicked shall prevail against you. You dwell in the secret place of the Most High, and under His shadow you abide securely.<br><br>

You are marked as just — justified by faith in Jesus Christ. Therefore, the mischief of the wicked cannot rest upon you. Your portion is preserved, your inheritance protected, and your testimony is this: Jehovah Nissi, the Lord your Banner, covers you. Walk in the assurance that your life is hidden with Christ, and no evil devised in the pits of hell shall overtake you.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I thank You for Your covenant of protection. I declare that I am the just, clothed in the righteousness of Jesus Christ. My life is secured in Your mighty hands. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.
