<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD'S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

<strong>FRIDAY 26TH JANUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>BE THE FIRST PARTAKER</strong><br><br>

<strong>2 Timothy 2:6</strong><br>
“The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.”<br><br>

God is a God of order, and in His kingdom, labour is rewarded with participation. The Scripture makes it clear that the one who works must be the first to enjoy the fruit. This is not only about farming; it is a spiritual principle. If you are committed, consistent, and present, you are qualified to partake first.<br><br>

Mary Magdalene went early to the tomb to anoint the body of Jesus. Others stayed back, but she showed up. Because she showed up, she saw what others missed. When Jesus rose from the dead, He appeared to her first. Many believers are left behind not because God skipped them, but because they delayed (Mark 16:1–9).<br><br>

In John 5:7, the man at the pool of Bethesda had a sad testimony. He said, “while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.” For thirty-eight years, he watched others enter the water ahead of him. Opportunity came again and again, but he was never first.<br><br>

In Genesis 38:28, when the twins were being born, the midwife tied a scarlet thread on the hand of the child that came out first. That scarlet thread was a mark of distinction, a sign of priority.<br><br>

Spiritually, when you tie the scarlet thread and hunger for God, you are marked to partake first. Nothing good should pass you by.<br><br>

This is a call to rise early, stay alert, and remain engaged. Be faithful in service, steadfast in prayer, and committed to God’s work. The kingdom rewards readiness. Those who labour, show up, and stay positioned will always partake first.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, make me the first partaker in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>SUNDAY 25TH JANUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>THE VOICE OF ACCEPTANCE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 29:4–5</strong><br>
“The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty; the voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.”<br><br>

There is a voice that speaks over your life with ultimate authority. It is the Voice of Acceptance. This is the voice of God that approves, affirms, and says YES to the prayers of His children. It is powerful and full of majesty, breaking every obstacle to make a way for His word to come to pass.<br><br>

One day, this voice spoke from heaven over Jesus, saying, “This is my beloved Son: hear Him” (Luke 9:35). God the Father publicly approved His Son.<br><br>

Even through His mother Mary, a voice of acceptance pointed to Him, saying to the servants, “Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it” (John 2:5). These voices cleared the way for His ministry.<br><br>

Today, this same voice speaks over you. The God who approved His own Son is your Father.<br><br>

His voice of acceptance silences every other voice. It breaks the cedars of rejection, delay, and disapproval in your life. When God says “yes,” no person or power can successfully say “no.”<br><br>

I pray for you today that the same voice that approved our Lord Jesus will approve you also in Jesus’ Name. The voice of the LORD will silence every voice speaking against you in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, let Your voice approve me this day in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>RESIST THE DEVIL</strong><br><br>

<strong>James 4:7</strong><br>
“Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”<br><br>

The command to resist is a declaration of spiritual authority granted to the believer. It is not a suggestion, but a sovereign strategy for victory. Notice the divine order: first, full submission to God. Submission aligns us under His rule and places us within the covering of His authority.<br><br>

The enemy’s tactics are consistent, accusation, deception, temptation, and intimidation. But his power was broken at the cross. When you resist him from your position in Christ, you are not fighting for victory, you are enforcing the victory already won by Jesus.<br><br>

Do not be dismayed by his persistence or the roar of his threats. Your stand is not in your own strength, but in the might of the King you serve. Just as a soldier stands firm not by personal power but by the authority of the nation he represents, you stand in the authority of the name of Jesus.<br><br>

The promise is clear. It does not say he *may* flee. It says he *will* flee. Your consistent, faith-filled resistance activates his compulsory retreat. When you submit to God and stand your ground in truth, the enemy has no option but to withdraw.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I submit every area of my heart, mind, and life to You. I take my stand in the authority of Christ, and I resist the devil. I declare that every work of darkness flees from my life, my home, and my destiny. I walk in victory through Jesus’ name. Amen.
