  <strong>A NEW THING, A FRESH PATH</strong><br><br>

  The page has turned.
  The old has passed away,
  and a new year has come.
  This moment is a gift
  from the hand of the Father,
  a fresh path,
  a morning filled with mercy.
  Do not step into it
  carrying the heavy bundles
  of last year’s fears.
  Step into it
  with a heart prepared
  for what God will do.<br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 43:18–19</strong><br>
  “Remember ye not the former things,
  neither consider the things of old.
  Behold, I will do a new thing;
  now it shall spring forth;
  shall ye not know it?
  I will even make a way in the wilderness,
  and rivers in the desert.”<br><br>

  The path ahead is unknown to us.
  We cannot see around its bends.
  But we do not walk it alone,
  and we do not walk it blind.
  We walk with the One
  who is already there.
  He goes before you.
  He levels the mountains
  and bridges the valleys.
  Your assignment
  is not to see the entire journey,
  but to trust the Guide
  for the very next step.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 3:5–6</strong><br>
  “Trust in the LORD with all thine heart;
  and lean not unto thine own understanding.
  In all thy ways acknowledge Him,
  and He shall direct thy paths.”<br><br>

  On this first day of the year,
  let us set our hearts.
  Let us plant our feet
  on this new path
  with holy expectation.
  In your spirit,
  speak one hope for 2026:<br><br>

  · One area where you will trust Him more.<br>
  · One habit you will ask Him to help you build.<br>
  · One person you will intentionally show His love to.<br>
  · One promise from His Word you will stand upon.<br><br>

  This act of expectation
  is an act of faith.
  It declares,
  “My God, I believe You are good.
  I believe Your plans for me are good.
  I am ready to follow.
  Help me.”<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I stand at the beginning of this new year
  with thanksgiving and with faith.
  You have been faithful,
  and You will remain faithful.
  I choose to trust You
  with all that lies ahead.
  Guide my steps.
  Order my path.
  My eyes are fixed on You.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.<br><br>

  May the Lord bless you in this new year.
  May you walk daily
  in His fresh mercies,
  His clear direction,
  and His unfailing grace.
  Welcome to 2026.

  <strong>FAITHFUL GOD, WE THANK YOU</strong><br><br>

  We are on the last page of the 2025 calendar.
  We stand in the sacred space
  between what has been
  and what will be.
  Before we cross over,
  we pause.
  We do not rush ahead.
  Instead, we look back,
  not with regret,
  but with recognition,
  searching for the footprints of God
  in the soil of the past twelve months.<br><br>

  <strong>Luke 17:14–19</strong><br><br>

  The year 2025 carried its own story.
  There were chapters of brilliant joy
  and paragraphs of profound difficulty.
  There were days that felt light and easy,
  and nights that felt long and heavy.<br><br>

  Yet even the hard ground of 2025
  was watered by His faithful care.
  God was sowing seeds
  in winters you could not see.
  He was building strength in the struggle.
  He was teaching your heart
  to trust His hand in the darkness.
  Every single morning,
  His mercy met you.<br><br>

  <strong>Lamentations 3:22–23</strong><br>
  “It is of the Lord’s mercies that we are not consumed,
  because His compassions fail not.
  They are new every morning:
  great is Thy faithfulness.”<br><br>

  On this final day of the year,
  offer a deliberate thanksgiving.
  In your heart,
  name one thing from 2025:<br><br>

  · One way He provided.<br>
  · One moment He gave you peace.<br>
  · One way you grew.<br>
  · One person He sent.<br>
  · One promise that held you.<br><br>

  To name them
  is to worship.
  It is to say,
  “I see Your goodness, Lord.
  I acknowledge it.
  I thank You for it.”<br><br>

  Gratitude seals the year
  and positions the heart for the next.
  As you step forward,
  do so with a thankful spirit,
  knowing the same faithful God
  who carried you through 2025
  has already gone ahead of you
  into 2026.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  all I have to say is
  thank You, Lord.
  For life, for mercy,
  for strength, and for grace.
  I enter the new season
  with a grateful heart.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>RIGHT THINKING</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Luke 1:28–37</strong><br>
  “And the angel came in unto Mary, and said,
  Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee:
  blessed art thou among women.<br><br>

  And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,
  and bring forth a son,
  and shalt call his name JESUS.<br><br>

  Then said Mary unto the angel,
  How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?<br><br>

  And the angel answered and said unto her,
  The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
  and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee:
  therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
  shall be called the Son of God.<br><br>

  And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth,
  she hath also conceived a son in her old age:
  and this is the sixth month with her,
  who was called barren.<br><br>

  For with God nothing shall be impossible.”<br><br>

  Immediately, Mary’s thinking changed.
  She moved from questioning
  to submission,
  from limitation
  to alignment.
  And she declared,
  <strong>“Be it unto me according to thy word.”</strong><br><br>

  Right thinking positions a man
  for divine manifestation.
  Until your thinking changes,
  your outcome remains the same.<br><br>

  The prodigal son also experienced
  a shift in thinking.
  First, he demanded his inheritance.
  Later, after losing everything,
  he thought again and said,
  “I will arise and go to my father.”
  That single thought
  restored his destiny.<br><br>

  <strong>Ephesians 3:20</strong><br>
  God is able to do exceedingly abundantly
  above all that we ask or think.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 23:7</strong><br>
  “For as a man thinketh in his heart,
  so is he.”<br><br>

  Your life will always move
  in the direction of your dominant thoughts.
  Think rightly,
  align your mind with God’s Word,
  and become a better version of yourself.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  align my thoughts with Your Word.
  Remove every limitation in my mind,
  and let my thinking produce Your will
  in my life.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.
