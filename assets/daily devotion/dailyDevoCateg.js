  <strong>SANCTIFY ME WHOLLY</strong><br><br>

  <strong>1 Thessalonians 5:23</strong><br>
  “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”<br><br>

  To be sanctified is to be set apart for God’s special use.
  And God does not want just a part of you—He wants all of you.
  “Wholly” means entirely, completely:
  spirit, soul, and body.<br><br>

  Many people try to give God their spirit on one day,
  but keep their soul—their mind, will, and emotions—for their own plans.
  They offer prayers,
  yet withhold their habits, disciplines, and physical choices.
  This is not sanctification; it is bargaining.
  A divided life cannot carry the peace of God,
  and a divided heart cannot shine with His glory.<br><br>

  God is the God of peace, not confusion.
  His peace flows when every room of your life
  is surrendered to His authority.
  Your spirit, your thoughts, your decisions,
  and even your body must come under His lordship.
  There is no lasting peace
  when part of you is still held back,
  afraid of what full surrender might cost.
  Just as a lamp cannot be half-lit,
  you cannot be half-sanctified
  and still fulfill your divine purpose.<br><br>

  The prayer for sanctification
  is a prayer of total surrender.
  It says,
  “Lord, every part of me belongs to You.
  I am not my own.
  Preserve me, keep me,
  and make me blameless,
  not by my strength,
  but by Your grace working in my whole being.”
  This is how a believer is prepared,
  not fragmented,
  but complete and filled with God.<br><br>

  Stop offering God fragments.
  He asks for the whole offering.
  Let there be no hidden room in your heart
  where doubts, fears, or secret sins are stored.
  Open every door,
  and allow the God of peace
  to sanctify you wholly.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, My God,
  I come to You with open hands.
  I hold nothing back.
  Sanctify me wholly—
  my spirit, my soul, and my body.
  Set every part of me apart
  for Your use completely.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.

  <strong>DON’T BE DOUBLE MINDED</strong><br><br>

  <strong>James 1:8</strong><br>
  “A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.”<br><br>

  A heart that tries to go two ways at once goes nowhere with God.
  To be double minded is to be divided in your heart—wanting God’s promise
  but also fearing the world’s way,
  trying to trust God while still making a backup plan that excludes Him.<br><br>

  This inner conflict produces instability.
  God is not found in the middle of confusion;
  He is found when you choose His side completely.
  Partial trust produces partial results,
  but God responds to full surrender.<br><br>

  The prophet Elijah confronted a double-minded people on Mount Carmel.
  He said,
  “How long halt ye between two opinions?
  if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him”
  (<strong>1 Kings 18:21</strong>).
  They had no answer.
  They wanted to keep both options open.
  But the fire of God only fell
  after Elijah made a single-minded, bold stand for the Lord alone.<br><br>

  James also warns us that when we ask God for wisdom,
  we must “ask in faith, nothing wavering”
  (<strong>James 1:6</strong>).
  A wavering heart is like a wave of the sea,
  driven and tossed by the wind.
  You cannot receive from God
  when your heart is divided between faith and fear.<br><br>

  God is a sure foundation.
  He calls you to plant your feet firmly on Him alone.
  You cannot hold God’s hand while clutching the world.
  You cannot claim His promise
  while listening to the enemy’s lie.<br><br>

  Choose this day whom you will serve.
  Decide to trust His Word alone.
  A single eye and a whole heart
  receive the full light of His guidance and blessing.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, My God,
  I choose to serve You alone.
  I reject double-mindedness,
  and I plant my faith firmly on Your Word.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.

  <strong>BRING YOUR STRONG REASON</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 41:21</strong><br>
  “Produce your cause, saith the LORD;
  bring forth your strong reasons,
  saith the King of Jacob.”<br><br>

  God knows who you are,
  but He desires that you know
  who you are in Him.
  You are not a stranger before His throne.
  You are a child with a voice,
  a covenant partner,
  one invited to reason with God.
  Your passionate, faith-filled desires
  are not hidden from Him;
  He calls you to bring them forth
  with strong reasons.<br><br>

  When King Hezekiah was told,
  “Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die,”
  he did not accept it silently.
  He turned his face to the wall and prayed.
  He presented a reason before God:
  that he had walked in truth
  and with a perfect heart.
  He appealed to God’s purpose,
  declaring that the grave cannot praise Him.
  God heard his reasoning
  and added fifteen years to his life.<br><br>

  When God’s wrath burned against Israel
  for the golden calf,
  Moses stood in the gap.
  He did not merely beg for mercy;
  he reasoned with God.
  He appealed to God’s glory,
  His covenant,
  and His reputation among the nations.
  And the Lord relented
  because covenant reasoning was presented.<br><br>

  God is not moved by empty complaints,
  but He is moved by faith-filled reasoning.
  He responds to prayers rooted
  in His Word,
  His promises,
  and His character.
  The desires He has placed in your heart
  are not accidents;
  they are invitations.<br><br>

  Do not bury them.
  Do not whisper them in fear.
  Bring them boldly before His throne.
  Remind Him of His Word.
  Appeal to His faithfulness.
  Declare what His victory in your life
  will proclaim to your world.
  This is not disrespect;
  it is faith in action.
  It is the confidence of a beloved child
  who knows the Father’s heart.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I come before Your throne
  with boldness and faith.
  I bring the desires You have placed within me,
  and I present my strong reasons
  based on Your unfailing Word
  and Your glorious character.
  Let Your will be done in my life,
  and let my testimony bring You praise.
  In Jesus’ name,
  Amen.
