  <strong>BRING YOUR STRONG REASON</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 41:21</strong><br>
  “Produce your cause, saith the LORD;
  bring forth your strong reasons,
  saith the King of Jacob.”<br><br>

  God knows who you are,
  but He desires that you know
  who you are in Him.
  You are not a stranger before His throne.
  You are a child with a voice,
  a covenant partner,
  one invited to reason with God.
  Your passionate, faith-filled desires
  are not hidden from Him;
  He calls you to bring them forth
  with strong reasons.<br><br>

  When King Hezekiah was told,
  “Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die,”
  he did not accept it silently.
  He turned his face to the wall and prayed.
  He presented a reason before God:
  that he had walked in truth
  and with a perfect heart.
  He appealed to God’s purpose,
  declaring that the grave cannot praise Him.
  God heard his reasoning
  and added fifteen years to his life.<br><br>

  When God’s wrath burned against Israel
  for the golden calf,
  Moses stood in the gap.
  He did not merely beg for mercy;
  he reasoned with God.
  He appealed to God’s glory,
  His covenant,
  and His reputation among the nations.
  And the Lord relented
  because covenant reasoning was presented.<br><br>

  God is not moved by empty complaints,
  but He is moved by faith-filled reasoning.
  He responds to prayers rooted
  in His Word,
  His promises,
  and His character.
  The desires He has placed in your heart
  are not accidents;
  they are invitations.<br><br>

  Do not bury them.
  Do not whisper them in fear.
  Bring them boldly before His throne.
  Remind Him of His Word.
  Appeal to His faithfulness.
  Declare what His victory in your life
  will proclaim to your world.
  This is not disrespect;
  it is faith in action.
  It is the confidence of a beloved child
  who knows the Father’s heart.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I come before Your throne
  with boldness and faith.
  I bring the desires You have placed within me,
  and I present my strong reasons
  based on Your unfailing Word
  and Your glorious character.
  Let Your will be done in my life,
  and let my testimony bring You praise.
  In Jesus’ name,
  Amen.

  <strong>PRAYER FOR BUSINESS BREAKTHROUGH</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Deuteronomy 28:12</strong><br>
  “The Lord shall open unto thee
  his good treasure, the heaven
  to give the rain unto thy land in his season,
  and to bless all the work of thine hand:
  and thou shalt lend unto many nations,
  and thou shalt not borrow.”<br><br>

  Scripture assures us that those
  who do business in great waters
  will see the works of the Lord.
  God Himself delights
  in blessing the works of our hands
  and guiding us safely
  into seasons of increase.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 107:23</strong><br>
  “They that go down to the sea in ships,
  that do business in great waters;
  these see the works of the LORD,
  and his wonders in the deep.”<br><br>

  Breakthrough in business
  is not merely about profit.
  It is about God’s presence
  commanding favor,
  opening divine opportunities,
  and releasing supernatural increase.
  When God is involved,
  impossibilities bow.<br><br>

  Joseph prospered even in slavery
  because the Lord was with him.
  His management carried divine wisdom,
  and everything placed in his hands flourished.
  Isaac sowed in famine
  and reaped a hundredfold,
  not because the season was favorable,
  but because God was present.<br><br>

  Beloved,
  as you launch out
  into the great waters of life,
  commit your business fully to the Lord.
  Let Him be your source,
  your strategist,
  and your rewarder.
  He will command the rains of favor
  to fall upon your labor
  and open the treasures of heaven over you.<br><br>

  I declare today:
  the Lord is blessing the work of your hands.
  Your business shall not sink,
  it shall rise.
  You will see the wonders of God
  in your enterprise.
  You will prosper in every season,
  and your increase will glorify God.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  bless my business
  and the works of my hands.
  Lead me through great waters,
  open doors of divine opportunity,
  and cause me to prosper
  until I become a blessing to others.
  Let my success bring glory to Your name,
  in Jesus’ name.
  Amen.

  <strong>BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Matthew 5:9</strong><br>
  “Blessed are the peacemakers:
  for they shall be called
  the children of God.”<br><br>

  A peacemaker is not merely
  someone who avoids trouble.
  A peacemaker is one
  who brings <em>shalom</em>,
  God’s wholeness,
  healing,
  and reconciliation
  into places of brokenness.<br><br>

  Peacemakers step into the gap
  between arguments,
  between friends who no longer speak,
  and even into their own angry thoughts.
  They choose the hard work
  of restoring calm,
  truth,
  and love.<br><br>

  The world produces troublemakers,
  but God raises peacemakers.
  And Jesus calls them blessed.
  Why?
  Because when you make peace,
  you reflect the nature of your Father.<br><br>

  God Himself is the ultimate peacemaker.
  He sent Jesus
  to make peace
  between humanity and Himself.
  When you forgive,
  reconcile,
  or calm a quarrel,
  you are acting like God.
  That is why peacemakers
  are called the children of God,
  they carry the family resemblance.<br><br>

  <strong>Colossians 1:20</strong><br>
  “And, having made peace
  through the blood of his cross,
  by him to reconcile all things unto himself.”<br><br>

  This blessing is not for those
  who run away from conflict.
  It is for those
  who courageously allow God’s healing
  to flow through them
  in the middle of conflict.
  It may be in your home,
  in your workplace,
  or within your own heart.<br><br>

  Today,
  ask God to show you
  one place where you can be a peacemaker.
  Speak kind words.
  Let go of a grudge.
  Refuse to pass on gossip.
  In that moment,
  you are not just keeping peace,
  you are creating it.
  And heaven recognizes you
  as its own.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  endue me with the grace
  to make peace everywhere I go.
  Let my life reflect Your nature,
  in Jesus’ name.
  Amen.
