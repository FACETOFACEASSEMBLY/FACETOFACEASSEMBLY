<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>


<strong>THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 80:1</strong><br>
“Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.”<br><br>

The revelation of God as Shepherd is one of the greatest mysteries of covenant security. He is the Shepherd of Israel—the One who leads, protects, preserves, and causes His flock to triumph. A walk with the Shepherd is a victorious walk; when we truly follow Him, we walk a path free from confusion, lack, and abandonment. It is a walk where nothing is missing and nothing is broken.<br><br>

Jesus demonstrated this system in <strong>Luke 22:35</strong> when He asked His disciples if they lacked anything when He sent them out without purse or scrip. Their answer was, “Nothing.” This is the Shepherd’s system: when He leads, provision follows. When He sends, supply answers. When He guides, preservation is guaranteed.<br><br>

<strong>Psalm 23:1</strong> declares, “The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.” Notice it does not say "I may not want." When the Lord is truly your Shepherd, fear loses its voice and lack loses its power. Goodness and mercy become your daily companions. May the good Lord shepherd you all the days of your life.<br><br>

Declare this boldly: The Lord is my Shepherd. I shall not want. I shall not lack. I shall not be stranded. I walk in divine guidance, divine provision, and divine preservation in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>OH LORD GIVE ME A NEW SONG</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 40:3</strong><br>
“And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.”<br><br>

Before a breakthrough appears publicly, Heaven often shifts something internally. Hope rises, and the burdens that once felt heavy begin to feel lighter—this is the beginning of a new song. A new song is not just about music; it is about testimony. It is the spiritual evidence that God has moved on your behalf.<br><br>

When God lifts you from the pit of despair, He places a new sound within you. He becomes your song, your strength, and your salvation. When God does a new thing, your declaration changes to: “The Lord has done it; my season has changed; mercy has spoken for me and my family.” Often, you don’t even realize the song has changed until you look back and see that you survived what was meant to destroy you.<br><br>

Beloved, you may still be in the middle of your story, but do not worry. The God who gave Hannah a song of triumph will give you yours as well. The God who turned David’s mourning into dancing remains the same today. To everyone who is tired: a new song is coming to you very soon in the name of the Lord.<br><br>

When God finishes what He has started in your life, people will hear of it and declare with you that this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, give me a new song; turn my mourning into dancing in Jesus’ name. Amen.

<strong>THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD IS STRETCHED OUT STILL</strong><br><br>

<strong>Isaiah 9:12</strong><br>
“For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.”<br><br>

The right hand of God speaks of His power, His authority, and His ability to save, deliver, and judge (<strong>Psalm 118:16</strong>). When the scripture says, “His hand is stretched out still,” it means God has not withdrawn His power; He has not folded His hands. His divine ability remains active on behalf of His children.<br><br>

Even when God corrected Israel for their sins, His hand remained stretched out. This is because God’s stretched-out hand is not only for judgment; it is also for mercy. It was His right hand that parted the Red Sea, defeated mighty enemies, and lifted Peter when he began to sink in the storm. Today, that same hand is stretched out toward you to save and restore you.<br><br>

You may feel forgotten, delayed, or unworthy, but God’s hand is still reaching for you. If you are in sin, His hand calls you to repentance; if you are weak, it offers strength; and if you are tired, it offers rest. The same hand that created the heavens is reaching toward you—do not run away from it, but rather run to it.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, I thank You because Your right hand is stretched out still. Stretch it towards me in mercy; lift me where I have fallen and strengthen me in Jesus' name. Amen.
</p>
