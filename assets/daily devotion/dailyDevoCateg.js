<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

<strong>SUNDAY 25TH JANUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>THE VOICE OF ACCEPTANCE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 29:4–5</strong><br>
“The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty; the voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.”<br><br>

There is a voice that speaks over your life with ultimate authority. It is the Voice of Acceptance. This is the voice of God that approves, affirms, and says YES to the prayers of His children. It is powerful and full of majesty, breaking every obstacle to make a way for His word to come to pass.<br><br>

One day, this voice spoke from heaven over Jesus, saying, “This is my beloved Son: hear Him” (Luke 9:35). God the Father publicly approved His Son.<br><br>

Even through His mother Mary, a voice of acceptance pointed to Him, saying to the servants, “Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it” (John 2:5). These voices cleared the way for His ministry.<br><br>

Today, this same voice speaks over you. The God who approved His own Son is your Father.<br><br>

His voice of acceptance silences every other voice. It breaks the cedars of rejection, delay, and disapproval in your life. When God says “yes,” no person or power can successfully say “no.”<br><br>

I pray for you today that the same voice that approved our Lord Jesus will approve you also in Jesus’ Name. The voice of the LORD will silence every voice speaking against you in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, let Your voice approve me this day in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>RESIST THE DEVIL</strong><br><br>

<strong>James 4:7</strong><br>
“Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”<br><br>

The command to resist is a declaration of spiritual authority granted to the believer. It is not a suggestion, but a sovereign strategy for victory. Notice the divine order: first, full submission to God. Submission aligns us under His rule and places us within the covering of His authority.<br><br>

The enemy’s tactics are consistent, accusation, deception, temptation, and intimidation. But his power was broken at the cross. When you resist him from your position in Christ, you are not fighting for victory, you are enforcing the victory already won by Jesus.<br><br>

Do not be dismayed by his persistence or the roar of his threats. Your stand is not in your own strength, but in the might of the King you serve. Just as a soldier stands firm not by personal power but by the authority of the nation he represents, you stand in the authority of the name of Jesus.<br><br>

The promise is clear. It does not say he *may* flee. It says he *will* flee. Your consistent, faith-filled resistance activates his compulsory retreat. When you submit to God and stand your ground in truth, the enemy has no option but to withdraw.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I submit every area of my heart, mind, and life to You. I take my stand in the authority of Christ, and I resist the devil. I declare that every work of darkness flees from my life, my home, and my destiny. I walk in victory through Jesus’ name. Amen.

<strong>THE GOD WHO SHUTS THE MOUTH OF LIONS</strong><br><br>

<strong>Daniel 6:22</strong><br>
“My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me.”<br><br>

The testimony of Daniel is a mighty proclamation of God’s deliverance. Thrown into a den of hungry lions for his faithfulness, he spent the night with them, untouched. Why? Because the Living God sent His angel to shut their mouths. God did not remove Daniel from the den, but He rendered the lions powerless within the den.<br><br>

That same power is alive today. The God of Daniel is your God. The enemies that roar against you, whether people, circumstances, accusations, or fears, have a mouth that can be shut. Their ability to harm you, intimidate you, or devour your peace and destiny can be divinely neutralized by the command of Heaven.<br><br>

Do not be terrified by the roaring. The lions roared all night around Daniel, yet he was preserved. Your faith in the Living God is your safe place. Your consistent prayer life and unwavering commitment to God, like Daniel’s, activate angelic intervention and the silencing power of God.<br><br>

Stand firm in faith and decree it boldly: The same power that shut the mouths of lions will shut the mouth of every enemy speaking against my life, my family, my purpose, and my peace. This victory is not by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, the Deliverer of Daniel, I thank You for Your mighty power. I declare that the same angelic ministry that shut the lions’ mouths is active on my behalf today. In the mighty name of Jesus, I command every roaring mouth of the enemy against my life to be shut, silenced, and rendered powerless. I walk in divine protection and peace, for my life is hid in Christ. Amen.
