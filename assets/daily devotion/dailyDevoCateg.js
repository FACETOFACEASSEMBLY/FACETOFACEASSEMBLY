  <strong>THE SPIRIT OF WEALTH AND RICHES</strong><br><br>

  <strong>2 Corinthians 8:9</strong><br>
  “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.”<br><br>

  Today, in our Season of Alleluia, the Spirit of God lifts the veil on the covenant of divine prosperity. Our shout of “Alleluia” is the sound of a heart that has discovered true riches—wealth that begins in the spirit and transforms the wilderness of lack into a fertile field of abundance.<br><br>

  True riches are first spiritual, then natural. Scripture declares: “Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever” (Psalm 112:3). This is the wealth of a peaceful home, children walking in truth, and health sustained by God’s hand. Wealth and riches are twin blessings that follow the covenant keeper.<br><br>

  Before you can walk in overflow, you must return to the Source. It is the outpouring of the Spirit that changes your landscape: “Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field…” (Isaiah 32:15). God does not just give things; He gives His Spirit, and His Spirit gives power, wisdom, ideas, and opportunities.<br><br>

  “But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth” (Deuteronomy 8:18). When God gives, He gives completely. Wealth has a voice that commands honour. Joseph of Arimathaea, a rich man, walked into the presence of authority and boldly asked for the body of Jesus (Matthew 27:57). Wealth speaks where mere desire is silent.<br><br>

  Believer, this is your inheritance. Christ became poor so that you might be rich in grace, favour, and divine provision. Your “Alleluia” today is not a cry from lack but a declaration from covenant abundance. You are not a beggar—you are a child of the King. Align with your Source and command your environment to reflect your spiritual riches in Christ.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father and my God, I return to You as my only Source. Pour out Your Spirit upon my life, my mind, and the work of my hands. Let every wilderness in my finances, health, and family be transformed into a fruitful field and a forest of abundance. I receive the spirit of wealth and riches—the divine power to create, gather, and enjoy Your provision in peace. I break every curse of poverty, debt, and failure, and I walk in covenant prosperity, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

  <strong>I AM A MAN UNDER AUTHORITY</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Matthew 8:6-9</strong><br>
  “Lord, my servant lies at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.” And Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.” The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”<br><br>

  Today, we step deeper into our Season of Alleluia by unlocking a profound mystery — the mystery of divine authority. Our shout of “Alleluia” is not only in gratitude for what God has done, but in recognition of the position He has given us to enforce His will on earth.<br><br>

  The centurion’s faith astonished Jesus because he understood the principle of delegated authority. He said, “I am a man under authority.” His ability to command came from the power he was submitted to. Because he was under authority, he could speak with authority.<br><br>

  Beloved, this is your kingdom identity. You are not ordinary, and you are not operating alone. You are a man, a woman, UNDER AUTHORITY — the supreme authority of Jesus Christ. And because you are under His Lordship, His authority flows through you. You speak in the power of His name.<br><br>

  Scripture declares: “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God…” (John 1:12). As a child of God, you carry divine authority. Jesus entrusted you with power over all devils (Luke 9:1) and with the ability to command mountains to move (Mark 11:23).<br><br>

  Just as Jesus stood at the tomb of Lazarus and issued a command (John 11:43), you also have been empowered to speak to situations in His name:<br><br>

  · You can call FORTH favor, connections, and prosperity, and they must come.<br>
  · You can command TO GO sickness, poverty, shame, and oppression, and they must flee.<br><br>

  Your words are not empty. When aligned with God’s Word, they become spiritual mandates. Heaven backs them. Angels respond to them. Darkness fears them. The centurion knew that authority makes words powerful — and when you speak in the name of Jesus, all of heaven enforces your declaration.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father My God, I declare that I am a man under Your authority. Today, I call forth my inheritance of health, prosperity, favor, and peace. I command every force of lack, sickness, and shame to depart from my life and my household. My “Alleluia” is the shout of a victorious soldier in Your army. As I have believed, so let it be unto me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

  <strong>WELCOME TO THE SEASON OF ALLELUIA</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Revelation 19:1-2, 6</strong><br>
  “And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: For true and righteous are his judgments... And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.”<br><br>

  Today, I welcome you into a divine moment — the <strong>Season of Alleluia</strong>. This is a holy time of gratitude, a spiritual pause where you look back from January until now and recognize the countless ways God has carried you, protected you, restored you, provided for you, and shown you mercy.<br><br>

  That word “Alleluia” is not ordinary. In Revelation 19, it is the roaring shout of heaven — the sound of victory, fulfilment, and overwhelming gratitude. Heaven shouts “Alleluia!” because every promise God made, He kept. Every word He spoke, He performed.<br><br>

  Your life this year echoes that same testimony. The difficult days you survived, the blessings you received unexpectedly, the dangers you escaped, the provisions that came right on time — these are not coincidences. They are the fingerprints of a faithful God. Each moment is a reminder that God does not fail (Numbers 23:19).<br><br>

  As you look back, your heart begins to swell with thanksgiving. That fullness of gratitude demands expression, and that expression is your “Alleluia!” It is your agreement with heaven that God has been good to you, powerful in your life, and consistent in His love.<br><br>

  The Psalmist said, “He has given me a new song to sing, a song of praise to our God” (Psalm 40:3). This season, your new song is simple but mighty: <strong>ALLELUIA!</strong> It is your shout of appreciation to the God who has carried you from the beginning of the year till now.<br><br>

  Do not hold it back. Let your Alleluia rise from a heart that has seen the faithfulness of God. Let it be a testimony, a declaration, and a celebration of the One who reigns forever.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father My God, I thank You for this Season of Alleluia. As I look back on this year, I see Your hand in every moment. I acknowledge Your faithfulness, Your mercy, and Your unfailing love. Today, I lift my voice with the hosts of heaven and declare: ALLELUIA! Let Your goodness continue in my life, and let Your glory be revealed in all that concerns me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
</p>
