  <strong>YOUR MOURNING WILL TURN TO DANCING</strong><br><br>

  “You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; You have put off my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness.”<br>
  <em>— Psalm 30:11</em><br><br>

  I will never forget the day a woman came to me, her body shaking with violent sobs. Her son had been kidnapped.
  The pain was so deep she could barely speak. Her lamentation came from a place of utter despair.<br><br>

  She fell to her knees, and all she could cry was, “My son, my son!” The situation looked impossible,
  the darkness overwhelming.<br><br>

  But in that very moment, the Spirit of God rose within me. I looked at her and declared a word from the Lord:
  “Go to the altar now and pour out your heart before God. But hear this — the same God who delivered Daniel
  from the lions’ den and the three Hebrew boys from the fiery furnace is alive today. He will do it for you.
  God will turn your mourning and your pain into dancing.”<br><br>

  It was a prophecy spoken into the middle of deep pain.<br><br>

  A few days later, I heard a commotion outside. It was her — but this time she was not crying.
  She was shouting, “Pastor! Pastor!” with a voice full of joy. She ran to me, her face shining,
  and right there she began to dance!<br><br>

  She testified, “They have released my son! He is free! God has done it!”<br><br>

  The same woman who was clothed with the sackcloth of mourning was now clothed with the gladness of victory.
  God had turned her wailing into a dance of joy.<br><br>

  Hear me today: whatever that mourning represents in your life — sickness, financial debt, a broken marriage,
  a wayward child — the God of Psalm 30:11 has not changed.<br><br>

  Your situation is not too hard for Him. Just as He turned that woman’s sorrow into celebration,
  He will turn yours too. Your crying season is ending, and your dancing season is beginning. Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, My God, turn every pain in my heart into joy. In Jesus' Name, Amen.

    prayer: `<p> <strong>OH LORD, DELIVER ME FROM POWERS STRONGER THAN ME</strong><br><br>

“He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.”<br>
<em>— Psalm 18:17</em><br><br>

There are moments in life when the battles we face seem bigger than our strength.
Some enemies are not physical — they are patterns, cycles, addictions, delays, family altars, fear, sicknesses,
or invisible forces resisting your progress.<br><br>

David understood this deeply. He confessed that some enemies were “too strong” for him,
but he also testified that God delivered him.<br><br>

Acknowledging that a battle is stronger than you is not weakness — it is humility.
It is the doorway to divine intervention. God cannot step into a fight you are still trying to win
by your own wisdom, willpower, or strategy.<br><br>

There are powers that fight destinies.
There are altars that resist families.
There are yokes that refuse to break by human strength.
But none of them are stronger than the God who fights for you.<br><br>

When sickness keeps returning,<br>
When financial cycles never break,<br>
When family patterns repeat across generations,<br>
When spiritual heaviness or fear surrounds you,<br>
When sin continually battles your walk with God —<br>
That is when you cry for help. Scripture says the battle belongs to the Lord.<br><br>

The Lord who rescued David will rescue you and your household today in Jesus’ Name.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I acknowledge that there are powers, cycles, and battles stronger than me,
but none of them are stronger than You.
Arise, O Lord, and deliver me today. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.

  <strong>POWER TO TAKE IT BACK</strong><br><br>

  “No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.”<br>
  <em>John 10:18</em><br><br>

  This verse reveals something extraordinary about Jesus. When He died, it appeared as though His life was taken by soldiers, rulers, and enemies. But Jesus made it clear that no man had the strength to take His life. He laid it down willingly. And beyond that, He had the divine power to take it back again — the power of resurrection.<br><br>

  That same resurrection power is at work in your life today. The enemy often tries to steal from us — our peace, our health, our joy, our relationships, our opportunities. Sometimes the losses feel final, like they can never be restored. But the testimony of Jesus says otherwise. Because Jesus could take back His life, you too can take back everything the enemy has stolen, through the authority of His name.<br><br>

  Think about David at Ziklag. The enemy burned down his camp and carried away his family and all his possessions. David and his men wept until they had no strength left. It looked like the end. But David sought the Lord, and God told him to pursue — and that he would recover all. David obeyed, fought, and took back everything that had been stolen.<br>
  <em>1 Samuel 30:1–8</em><br><br>

  This shows us that with God, loss is never the end of the story. You are not helpless. You are not defeated. Through Christ, you carry divine authority. You don’t have to accept the enemy’s theft. You can stand, pray, declare, and take back your joy, your health, your destiny, your opportunities, and your blessings. Restoration is your portion. Recovery is your right in Christ Jesus.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, by the power of Jesus at work in me, I take back everything the enemy has stolen from my life. I recover my peace, my health, my joy, and my blessings. I declare full restoration now, in Jesus’ name. Amen.
