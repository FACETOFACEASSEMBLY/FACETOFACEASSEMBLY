<strong>NO EVIL SHALL BEFALL THEE</strong><br><br>

“There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.”<br>
<em>— Proverbs 12:21</em><br><br>

As we continue in this blessed month, the Lord speaks a sure word of covering over your life. In a world filled with fear and hidden dangers, God has declared a fixed, unshakable promise concerning the righteous. You are not exposed to the traps of the enemy. The Lord Himself has decreed that evil shall not be your portion.<br><br>

“There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.”<br>
<em>— Psalm 91:10–11</em><br><br>

No weapon of eternal harm, no condemning verdict, no destructive power of the wicked shall prevail against you. You dwell in the secret place of the Most High, and under His shadow you abide securely.<br><br>

You are marked as just — justified by faith in Jesus Christ. Therefore, the mischief of the wicked cannot rest upon you. Your portion is preserved, your inheritance protected, and your testimony is this: Jehovah Nissi, the Lord your Banner, covers you. Walk in the assurance that your life is hidden with Christ, and no evil devised in the pits of hell shall overtake you.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I thank You for Your covenant of protection. I declare that I am the just, clothed in the righteousness of Jesus Christ. My life is secured in Your mighty hands. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.

    prayer: `<p> <strong>WELCOME TO DECEMBER: THE LORD SHALL BE YOUR EVERLASTING LIGHT</strong><br><br>

Isaiah 60:19
"The sun shall be no more your light by day, neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto you: but the LORD shall be unto you an everlasting light, and your God your glory."

As we enter this sacred month, God's word delivers a promise that transcends the changing seasons. In Isaiah, the Lord declares a profound shift from natural, temporary illumination to divine, eternal radiance. You were not designed to depend on earthly sources of light.  The Lord himself appoints himself your Everlasting Light.

But how can we walk in this supernatural light in our daily lives? Psalm 27:1 provides the foundation for this promise: "The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?" This scripture confirms that the Everlasting Light is a present reality for every generation that puts its trust in Him. This promise was written for you this December, for this moment in your journey.

You may walk through personal nights of uncertainty, waiting, or grief. The year may be closing with shadows you did not anticipate. Yet these two scriptures dissolve all fear. Your Everlasting Light is also your salvation and your strength. Every step taken in faith, these are acts of walking in the Light that has no end. You are living proof that God's glory outshines every temporary darkness.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, as I enter this month, let me walk in the radiance of your everlasting light. Be my glory in every situation, and let my life reflect your unending dawn.

    prayer: `<p> <strong>CREATED FOR HIS PRAISE</strong><br><br>

“This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.”<br>
<em>— Isaiah 43:21</em><br><br>

There is a divine thread of purpose woven from eternity straight into your life. In Isaiah, God makes a profound declaration: you are a people shaped, fashioned, and intentionally designed by Him. You were not created accidentally or without direction. Your existence carries heavenly intention — you were formed for God Himself, to reveal His excellence, His character, and His glory.<br><br>

Your life is not random. It is a divine instrument meant to display His praise.<br><br>

How do we know this includes us today? Psalm 102 gives the assurance:<br><br>

“This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord.”<br>
<em>— Psalm 102:18</em><br><br>

This means you were seen, known, and included in God’s eternal plan long before you were born. You are part of a prophetic generation created for praise. Your very breath is proof of divine intention. Every moment of gratitude, every song of worship, every act of faith — these are the ways you “shew forth” the praise of the One who formed you.<br><br>

When you question your purpose or value, these scriptures remove all doubt: your highest calling is to reflect God’s worth. Everything about your life was designed to point back to Him.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, let my life continually bring glory to Your name. Amen.

</p>
