<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>



<strong>GOD’S LOVE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Romans 5:8</strong><br>
“But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”<br><br>

God’s love is not ordinary love. It is not based on feelings, performance, or what we deserve. The Bible reveals that Christ died for us while we were yet sinners; He loved us before we changed, before we repented, and even at our worst. This is the definition of real love.<br><br>

While human love often depends on being pleased or treated well, God’s love reached out to us even when we were far from Him. In <strong>Jeremiah 31:3</strong>, He declares, “I have loved thee with an everlasting love.” Everlasting means it never ends, never grows weak, and never changes with time. Though friends and people may fail or disappoint you, God’s love remains constant.<br><br>

The ultimate proof of this love is found in <strong>John 3:16</strong>—the sacrifice of His only begotten Son. The cross is the eternal evidence of your value. When you truly understand God’s love, you stop begging for acceptance and move away from living in fear or doubting your worth.<br><br>

God’s love provides you with security, identity, and peace—not because you are perfect, but because He is love (<strong>1 John 4:16</strong>). Rest in the assurance that you are cherished by the Almighty today.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, Thank You for loving me with an everlasting love. Help me to rest in Your love daily in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>PERILOUS TIMES</strong><br><br>

<strong>2 Timothy 3:1</strong><br>
“This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.”<br><br>

The word "perilous" means dangerous, hard, stressful, and troubling. The Bible does not say perilous times <em>might</em> come; it says they <em>shall</em> come. Apostle Paul warned that in these times, men would be lovers of themselves, covetous, proud, unholy, and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Looking around today, we see these truths manifesting as wickedness increases and the fear of God diminishes.<br><br>

As Christians, we should not be surprised or panic. Jesus already told us that as iniquity abounds, the love of many would grow cold (<strong>Matthew 24:12</strong>). Perilous times are not a signal to run away from God, but a sign to hold tighter to His Word. We are instructed to continue in the things we have learned and been assured of (<strong>2 Timothy 3:14</strong>).<br><br>

In these difficult seasons, our responsibility is to stand on the Word, live in holiness, pray without ceasing, and refuse to follow the crowd or water down the truth. Our prayer should not just be for the removal of the times, but for the grace to remain standing.<br><br>

Perilous times are certain, but God’s grace is always greater. No matter how dark the world becomes, the grace of God is sufficient to keep you and your household sanctified and secure.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, give me grace to stand with Your Word. Sanctify me and my household daily in Jesus' Name. Amen.

<strong>EVIDENCE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Revelation 12:10</strong><br>
“For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.”<br><br>

Evidence is a testimony, material, or object used to prove a point. In <strong>Genesis 39</strong>, when Joseph fled from Potiphar’s wife to maintain his integrity, he left his garment behind. That garment became false evidence used to put an innocent man in prison. Even though Joseph was blameless, the evidence in her hand spoke against him.<br><br>

We see a different outcome in <strong>Luke 22:49–51</strong>. When Peter cut off the ear of the high priest's servant, that ear on the ground was evidence that could have sent Peter to prison. However, Jesus touched the man and healed him. By doing so, Jesus removed the evidence and saved Peter from the consequences of his actions.<br><br>

Beloved, the devil is an accuser who uses past mistakes, sins, and failures as evidence against us day and night. But we have a greater Advocate in Jesus Christ. When Jesus steps in with mercy, accusation loses its power. Just as He restored the servant's ear, He can destroy every record of failure or object of accusation that the enemy holds against you.<br><br>

Today, ask the Lord to wipe away every proof of sin and every record of failure speaking against your destiny. When Jesus heals and forgives, the negative evidence is destroyed forever.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, by the power in the blood of Jesus, I cancel every evidence against me and my household in Jesus' Name. Amen.
