  <strong>GLORIOUS THINGS SHALL BE SPOKEN OF ME</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 87:3</strong><br>
  “Glorious things are spoken of thee,
  O city of God.”<br><br>

  Everyone desires a good name.
  Everyone longs to be remembered for good,
  to leave behind a mark
  that shines with honour and praise.<br><br>

  This scripture reveals
  a powerful truth:
  the Lord Himself
  speaks glorious things
  over His people.
  He calls us His city,
  His dwelling place,
  and He fills our story
  with beauty,
  purpose,
  and divine praise.<br><br>

  From the beginning,
  God intended glorious things for us.
  We are fearfully
  and wonderfully made,
  called out of darkness
  into His marvellous light,
  and destined
  to reflect His glory
  in the earth.<br><br>

  However,
  this glorious testimony
  can be dimmed
  by sin,
  doubt,
  worldly living,
  and forgetting
  who God says we are.<br><br>

  <strong>If you desire glorious things to be spoken of you, you must:</strong><br><br>

  Live continually
  in God’s presence.<br><br>

  Walk daily
  in the Spirit.<br><br>

  Serve in love,
  for greatness
  in God’s kingdom
  is measured by service.<br><br>

  Declare God’s Word continually,
  allowing His truth
  to shape your identity
  and testimony.<br><br>

  No one accidentally
  lives a glorious life.
  But as you align yourself
  with God’s purpose,
  I declare today,
  glorious things
  shall be spoken of you
  in Jesus’ Name.
  Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  let my life
  reflect Your glory.
  Let my story
  bring You praise,
  and let my testimony
  honour Your name.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>HOW TO BE GREAT</strong><br><br>

  <strong>1 Chronicles 29:11–12</strong><br>
  “Thine, O LORD, is the greatness,
  and the power,
  and the glory,
  and the victory,
  and the majesty:
  for all that is in the heaven
  and in the earth is thine;
  thine is the kingdom, O LORD,
  and thou art exalted as head above all.<br>
  Both riches and honour come of thee,
  and thou reignest over all;
  and in thine hand is power and might;
  and in thine hand it is
  to make great,
  and to give strength unto all.”<br><br>

  Everyone desires greatness.
  Greatness makes a man
  a light to the world,
  a source of hope,
  and a vessel of impact.
  Yet true greatness
  is not self-generated;
  it is God-given.<br><br>

  These scriptures reveal
  a foundational truth:
  greatness belongs to God alone.
  Power, honour, victory,
  and elevation flow from Him.
  Therefore,
  anyone who seeks greatness
  must first acknowledge God
  as the only true source of it.<br><br>

  From the beginning,
  God created man great.
  We were made in His image
  and likeness,
  crowned with glory and honour,
  and given dominion.
  That is greatness by design.<br><br>

  However,
  greatness can be hindered
  or diminished
  by laziness,
  excessive sleep,
  lack of knowledge,
  and distractions.
  What God plants as potential
  must be nurtured
  with intentional living.<br><br>

  <strong>If you desire greatness, you must be willing to:</strong><br><br>

  Make the right decisions.<br><br>

  Follow great and godly examples.<br><br>

  Live a disciplined and consistent life.<br><br>

  Be patient,
  because greatness is a process,
  not an event.<br><br>

  Scripture confirms this journey:
  Genesis 1:26–28,
  Daniel 9:2,
  Job 8:7,
  John 14:12,
  Proverbs 4:18,
  Psalm 8:5.<br><br>

  No one wakes up suddenly great.
  But as you walk this path,
  step by step,
  God Himself
  will make you great,
  and give you strength
  to sustain it.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  Father, my God,
  I receive grace
  to walk the path of greatness.
  Make me great
  according to Your will,
  and strengthen me
  for the journey ahead.
  In Jesus’ name,
  Amen.

  <strong>THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 23:1 (End)</strong><br>
  “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.”<br><br>

  The most beautiful thing a sheep can know
  is the voice and the presence of its shepherd.
  For the believer,
  to say “The Lord is my Shepherd”
  is to make the most powerful confession
  of trust and belonging.<br><br>

  It is to declare:
  “My life is not in my own hands;
  I am under the care
  of an all-knowing,
  all-powerful Guide.”<br><br>

  A shepherd does not merely feed the sheep;
  he leads them.
  He knows where the green pastures are
  and where the quiet waters flow.
  He sees hidden dangers,
  predators,
  and poisonous paths
  long before the sheep ever do.<br><br>

  When the psalmist says,
  “I shall not want,”
  it does not simply mean provision of food.
  It means lacking nothing
  that is truly needed
  for purpose,
  protection,
  and well-being.<br><br>

  Jesus confirmed this truth
  when He sent out His disciples without supplies
  and later asked them,
  “Lacked ye anything?”
  Their answer was simple and powerful:
  “Nothing.”
  Why?
  Because the Shepherd was with them.<br><br>

  Your Shepherd provides,
  yes,
  but He also positions you.
  He leads you to the right places
  at the right times
  for your protection
  and for His divine purpose.<br><br>

  He corrects your path
  with His rod of discipline
  and pulls you back
  with His staff of mercy.
  In the presence of your enemies—
  be they lack,
  fear,
  sickness,
  or oppression—
  He does not panic
  or retreat.<br><br>

  Instead,
  He prepares a table before you,
  a bold declaration
  that His provision
  is greater than every threat.
  He anoints your head with oil,
  a mark of blessing,
  healing,
  and separation unto Him.<br><br>

  His goodness and mercy
  are not occasional visits.
  They are constant companions,
  following you
  all the days of your life.<br><br>

  Walking with the Shepherd,
  therefore,
  is a walk of surrendered trust.
  It is not the absence of valleys,
  but the assurance of guidance through them.
  Every step is overseen,
  every need is known,
  and your destination is secure—
  to dwell in the house of the Lord forever.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I thank You for choosing me
  and calling me Your own.
  Help me to know Your voice more clearly
  and to follow You more closely,
  in Jesus’ name.
  Amen.
