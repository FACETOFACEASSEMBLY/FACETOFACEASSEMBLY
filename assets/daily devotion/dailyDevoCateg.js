<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD'S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>



<strong>WHO IS A CHRISTIAN?</strong><br><br>

<strong>Acts 11:26</strong><br>
“And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.”<br><br>

Many people today claim to be Christians, but few truly understand what the word means. A few days ago, I asked a young man who a Christian is, and he said, “A Christian is a person that follows God and eschews evil.” While that answer sounds right, it is incomplete.<br><br>

The truth is this: a Christian is a person who follows Jesus Christ. A Christian is one who believes in the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>

Many people follow God. The Jews follow God. Muslims follow God. Many religions believe in God. But what separates a Christian from others is Jesus. They will never agree with you on Jesus, but Christianity stands or falls on Him.<br><br>

The Bible says in Acts 11:26 that the disciples were called Christians. They did not name themselves. People watched their lives, studied their conduct, and saw their character, and then called them Christians. Their character revealed Christ.<br><br>

This teaches us a deep truth: your character matters. You are not a Christian because you attend church. You are called a Christian when your life looks like Christ.<br><br>

In Galatians 5:1, the Scripture says, “Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free…” A Christian is already delivered from bondage through Christ. Sin, darkness, and the flesh no longer have dominion. But that freedom must show evidence.<br><br>

In Galatians 5:22–23, the Bible reveals the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance. These fruits are the proof of a Christian life.<br><br>

A Christian must not walk in darkness. A Christian must walk in the light of Christ.<br><br>

The Bible says, “Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith” (Hebrews 12:2). Jesus is not only the beginning of our faith, He is also the standard. When we look unto Him, our lives are shaped to reflect Him.<br><br>

Christianity is not just confession; it is transformation. Not just belief, but becoming like Christ.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, help me to follow Jesus truly. Let my character reflect Christ. I look unto Jesus, the author and finisher of my faith, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>BE THE FIRST PARTAKER</strong><br><br>

<strong>2 Timothy 2:6</strong><br>
“The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.”<br><br>

God is a God of order, and in His kingdom, labour is rewarded with participation. The Scripture makes it clear that the one who works must be the first to enjoy the fruit. This is not only about farming; it is a spiritual principle. If you are committed, consistent, and present, you are qualified to partake first.<br><br>

Mary Magdalene went early to the tomb to anoint the body of Jesus. Others stayed back, but she showed up. Because she showed up, she saw what others missed. When Jesus rose from the dead, He appeared to her first. Many believers are left behind not because God skipped them, but because they delayed (Mark 16:1–9).<br><br>

In John 5:7, the man at the pool of Bethesda had a sad testimony. He said, “while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.” For thirty-eight years, he watched others enter the water ahead of him. Opportunity came again and again, but he was never first.<br><br>

In Genesis 38:28, when the twins were being born, the midwife tied a scarlet thread on the hand of the child that came out first. That scarlet thread was a mark of distinction, a sign of priority.<br><br>

Spiritually, when you tie the scarlet thread and hunger for God, you are marked to partake first. Nothing good should pass you by.<br><br>

This is a call to rise early, stay alert, and remain engaged. Be faithful in service, steadfast in prayer, and committed to God’s work. The kingdom rewards readiness. Those who labour, show up, and stay positioned will always partake first.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, make me the first partaker in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>THE VOICE OF ACCEPTANCE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 29:4–5</strong><br>
“The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty; the voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.”<br><br>

There is a voice that speaks over your life with ultimate authority. It is the Voice of Acceptance. This is the voice of God that approves, affirms, and says YES to the prayers of His children. It is powerful and full of majesty, breaking every obstacle to make a way for His word to come to pass.<br><br>

One day, this voice spoke from heaven over Jesus, saying, “This is my beloved Son: hear Him” (Luke 9:35). God the Father publicly approved His Son.<br><br>

Even through His mother Mary, a voice of acceptance pointed to Him, saying to the servants, “Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it” (John 2:5). These voices cleared the way for His ministry.<br><br>

Today, this same voice speaks over you. The God who approved His own Son is your Father.<br><br>

His voice of acceptance silences every other voice. It breaks the cedars of rejection, delay, and disapproval in your life. When God says “yes,” no person or power can successfully say “no.”<br><br>

I pray for you today that the same voice that approved our Lord Jesus will approve you also in Jesus’ Name. The voice of the LORD will silence every voice speaking against you in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, let Your voice approve me this day in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
</p>
