  <strong>JOY IS COMING</strong><br><br>

  Everyone desires joy.
  Everyone wants a heart full of gladness,
  a life that overflows with laughter and peace,
  no matter the season.<br><br>

  The Lord Himself is the giver of joy.
  He hears the prayers of your heart
  and answers in ways that fill your mouth with laughter
  and your spirit with delight.
  Just as He visited Zacharias,
  He will visit you with the assurance
  that your appointed joy is on the way.<br><br>

  <strong>Luke 1:13–14</strong><br><br>

  <strong>John 15:11</strong><br>
  “These things have I spoken unto you,
  that my joy might remain in you,
  and that your joy might be full.”<br><br>

  The Scripture also declares:<br>
  <strong>Isaiah 12:3</strong><br>
  “Therefore with joy shall ye draw water
  out of the wells of salvation.”<br><br>

  However, joy can be stolen.
  The Bible shows us that when joy withers,
  everything else begins to languish.<br>
  <strong>Joel 1:12</strong><br><br>

  You must guard your joy.
  Avoid anyone
  and any situation
  that drains your joy.
  Protect the well within you.<br><br>

  No one accidentally lives a joyful life
  in a sorrowful world.
  But as you fix your heart
  on the Father of lights,
  I declare today:
  <strong>Your joy is coming!</strong><br><br>

  God is restoring every lost celebration,
  filling your mouth with laughter,
  and causing your well to overflow.
  Your heart shall be light,
  and your days shall be glad,
  in Jesus’ Name.
  Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  restore my joy this day.
  Let every stolen gladness return,
  and let my heart overflow with Your joy.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>BUILD YOUR CHILDREN</strong><br><br>

  Until your children succeed,
  you have not succeeded.<br><br>

  Before you build houses for your children,
  build your children.<br>
  <strong>Isaiah 54:13</strong><br><br>

  Invest in your children.
  Inculcate norms,
  values,
  morals,
  standards,
  discipline,
  knowledge,
  wisdom,
  truth,
  understanding,
  and prayers into their lives.<br>
  <strong>Proverbs 23:23</strong><br><br>

  If you fail to build your children
  before building houses for them,
  they may sell those houses
  you laboured to build,
  even with your grave still in it.<br><br>

  Food for thought.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 22:6</strong><br>
  “Train up a child in the way he should go:
  and when he is old,
  he will not depart from it.”<br><br>

  Catch them young.
  Catch them young.
  Catch them young.<br><br>

  When children are raised from the cradle
  with godly values,
  it shapes their system,
  their character,
  and their destiny.
  These principles follow them through life,
  sharpening their decisions
  and forming their success story.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 144:12</strong><br><br>

  What is planted in them today
  becomes what stands for them tomorrow.
  And in turn,
  they will pass these same values
  to their own children,
  and the lineage continues beautifully.<br><br>

  <strong>Joel 1:3</strong><br><br>

  Before you build houses for your children,
  build your children.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I decree that my children
  are for signs and wonders.
  Let them walk in truth,
  wisdom,
  and divine purpose.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.<br>

  <strong>GLORIOUS THINGS SHALL BE SPOKEN OF ME</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 87:3</strong><br>
  “Glorious things are spoken of thee,
  O city of God.”<br><br>

  Everyone desires a good name.
  Everyone longs to be remembered for good,
  to leave behind a mark
  that shines with honour and praise.<br><br>

  This scripture reveals
  a powerful truth:
  the Lord Himself
  speaks glorious things
  over His people.
  He calls us His city,
  His dwelling place,
  and He fills our story
  with beauty,
  purpose,
  and divine praise.<br><br>

  From the beginning,
  God intended glorious things for us.
  We are fearfully
  and wonderfully made,
  called out of darkness
  into His marvellous light,
  and destined
  to reflect His glory
  in the earth.<br><br>

  However,
  this glorious testimony
  can be dimmed
  by sin,
  doubt,
  worldly living,
  and forgetting
  who God says we are.<br><br>

  <strong>If you desire glorious things to be spoken of you, you must:</strong><br><br>

  Live continually
  in God’s presence.<br><br>

  Walk daily
  in the Spirit.<br><br>

  Serve in love,
  for greatness
  in God’s kingdom
  is measured by service.<br><br>

  Declare God’s Word continually,
  allowing His truth
  to shape your identity
  and testimony.<br><br>

  No one accidentally
  lives a glorious life.
  But as you align yourself
  with God’s purpose,
  I declare today,
  glorious things
  shall be spoken of you
  in Jesus’ Name.
  Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  let my life
  reflect Your glory.
  Let my story
  bring You praise,
  and let my testimony
  honour Your name.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.
