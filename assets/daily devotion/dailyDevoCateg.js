<strong>SCOURGE OF THE TONGUE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Job 5:21</strong><br>
“Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.”<br><br>

Scripture tells us that God will deliver us in times of trouble. One of these troubles is what the Bible calls “the scourge of the tongue.”<br><br>

The scourge of the tongue means suffering because of someone’s harmful words. These words can be bitter, full of curses, or evil wishes. But the Bible assures us that the plans and words of the enemy will not succeed.<br><br>

Just as Goliath’s threats against David came to nothing, God can silence every voice that speaks against your life, your family, your health, or your work. Jesus Himself showed His authority over every enemy when He confronted Saul on the road to Damascus. It is hard to kick against the pricks.<br><br>

Be encouraged, the Lord will silence every destructive word spoken against you. As Scripture declares, He will keep His saints and silence the mouths of the wicked.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I ask that every word spoken against me, my children, and all You have given me will fall to the ground, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>I AM UNSTOPPABLE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Jeremiah 1:19</strong><br>
“And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.”<br><br>

When you say, “I am unstoppable,” you are not speaking of your own power. You are declaring that you are like the wind, moved by the Spirit of God. As Gamaliel said in the Acts of the Apostles, if a purpose is of God, no one can stop it.<br><br>

Joseph was given a dream as a boy. His brothers, Potiphar’s wife, and even a prison cell all tried to stop that dream, but they could not. God made him unstoppable.<br><br>

Even our Lord Jesus faced resistance from Herod, the Pharisees, the cross, and the grave. Yet He was unstoppable. The resurrection proved that nothing could hold Him down.<br><br>

To be truly unstoppable, you must be rooted in the Lord.<br>
• You must rely on the power in His name.<br>
• You must trust Him for victory no matter the turbulence.<br>
• You must continually declare His Word.<br><br>

As Paul said, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” Your strength is a gift from Him.<br><br>

“If God be for us, who can be against us?”<br><br>

Connect your purpose to His will. Anchor your journey in His strength. When you do this, you are no longer just a person with a dream — you become a vessel of divine purpose that hell itself cannot overcome. Your path is ordained, your protection is assured, and your end is certain in Him.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, today I declare by Your power that I am unstoppable. Strengthen me with Your divine power, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>YOUR JOY CAN BE FULL</strong><br><br>

<strong>John 15:11</strong><br>
“These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.”<br><br>

Jesus spoke His words to us for a clear and wonderful purpose, so that His own joy would take root in our hearts, and so that our joy would be made full. This is not a joy that comes from our things or our plans. It is a joy that comes from His life living in us.<br><br>

Jesus said these things so that His joy would remain. To remain means to stay, to last, to be unshaken. If your joy is His joy, then it cannot be taken from you by the world, for it is rooted in heaven.<br><br>

A joy that is full has no empty space for fear or defeat. It is not a half-full cup, easily spilled. It is filled to the top and overflowing. This fullness comes from one place — abiding in His words and in His love. When you hold tightly to His promises, you are holding tightly to your joy. Your circumstances are not the source; He is the source.<br><br>

Do not let the thief steal what Jesus has given you. The enemy wants you to believe your joy depends on your family, your money, your health, or your success. But Jesus says your joy depends on Him alone. If you connect your joy to anything else, it will be divided and can be broken. But a joy connected to Christ is sealed and sure.<br><br>

Today, choose to receive His Word not as a burden, but as the keeper of your joy. Every command and every promise is a guardian of your heart’s gladness. All through 2026, let this be your truth: nothing shall separate me from the joy of the Lord, for it is His joy in me — and His joy is full, permanent, and victorious.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, let the joy of Jesus remain in me and be my strength. All through this year, let my joy be full, untouched by the world, and rooted in Your eternal love. I declare my joy is complete in You, in Jesus’ Name, Amen.
