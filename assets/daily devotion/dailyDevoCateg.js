    prayer: `<p>**I WILL OVERTURN, OVERTURN, OVERTURN**  

“I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.” — Ezekiel 21:27

When God says, “I will overturn,” it is a promise of divine intervention. It means He will dismantle every order, power, or person standing in the way of His purpose. God’s overturning is not random; it is a deliberate act to restore what belongs to His chosen ones.

Zephaniah 3:19 reveals the meaning behind this promise: “I will undo all that afflict thee.” The word “undo” carries the same power as “overturn.” God breaks the hold of the oppressor, silences the voice of affliction, and restores honour to those who have been shamed.

When God begins to overturn, it may look like chaos, but it is divine construction in motion. He removes wrong people from right positions and replaces them with those He has chosen. He overturns delay, disappointment, and demonic influence until His will is fully accomplished.

God’s overturning is His way of undoing affliction and restoring glory. When He begins to move, no force on earth or in hell can resist His hand. Wait for Him — He will not stop until He has placed you where you truly belong.

<br>
PRAYER: <br>
My Father, my God, overturn every affliction and opposition in my life. Replace shame with honour and cause me to rise where I have been cast down. Establish me in the place You have prepared for me, in Jesus’ mighty name, Amen.</p>

    prayer: `THE PLANT GOD FAVOURS DOESN’T NEED WATER TO SURVIVE  

“The plant God favours does not need water.” — Proverb  

This means that when God decides to bless a person, that person will flourish even in hard conditions. When divine favour rests upon you, what others struggle to get will come to you with ease. — Psalm 1:3  

A plant needs water to grow, but when God favours it, even if the rain delays, the plant will still blossom. The favour of God is a supernatural advantage. It opens doors that effort cannot open and attracts help where connections fail.  

Joseph was a man that God favoured. He was sold into slavery, yet the Lord was with him, and he became a prosperous man in the house of his master. He was in a dry land, but his life was green. His favour spoke louder than his location.  

Mary, the mother of Jesus, was also a woman favoured by God. The angel said to her, “Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee.” She was not the richest or the most known woman, yet God chose her to carry the Messiah. That is what favour does — it picks ordinary people and gives them extraordinary assignments.  

When God favours you, your background cannot stop your rising. People may not understand how you keep growing, succeeding, and shining even when things look hard — it is because heaven is watering you from above.  

Divine favour breaks natural rules. Isaac sowed in a time of famine and reaped a hundredfold in the same year. That is what happens when God waters you Himself. It is not of him that wills or runs, but of God that shows mercy.  

<br>
<br>
PRAYER: <br>
My Father, my God, make me like a tree planted by the rivers of water. Let Your divine favour water my life and cause me to flourish in every season, in Jesus’ mighty name, Amen.</p>`

    prayer: `<p>OH LORD, FIGHT FOR ME, I WANT TO HOLD MY PEACE  

“The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.” — Exodus 14:14  

Everyone has moments when the battles of life seem too fierce to fight. There are times when your strength fails, your wisdom is limited, and your resources are not enough. At such moments, God steps in as a Mighty Warrior. He doesn’t just assist you — He fights for you.  

When Israel stood before the Red Sea with Pharaoh’s army behind them, they had no weapon, no strategy, and no escape route. Yet, God told Moses, “The LORD shall fight for you.” It wasn’t their strength that divided the Red Sea; it was God’s power that made a way where there was no way.  

There are battles that belong to you, but there are also battles that belong to the Lord. The difference is in obedience and trust. When you trust God enough to stand still, He takes over. When you stop arguing, stop worrying, and stop fighting back in the flesh, you give room for God to manifest His power.  

You don’t need to fight everyone who opposes you — let God handle them. You don’t need to defend yourself before those who lie against you — God is your defender. You don’t need to strive to prove your worth — the God who called you will vindicate you.  

When God fights, He fights completely. He silences your accusers, confuses your enemies, and brings you out with victory that cannot be questioned.  

Declare with faith: Oh Lord, fight for me, I want to hold my peace. Let God arise, and every opposition against your destiny will scatter.  

<br>
<br>
PRAYER: <br>
My Father, my God, I surrender every battle to You. Fight for me, Lord, and give me peace on every side. Arise and let all who trouble my destiny be confounded. I choose to rest in Your power, for the battle is Yours. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>`
