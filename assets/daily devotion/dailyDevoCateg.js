<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

<strong>WHEN YOUR WAY PLEASES GOD</strong><br><br>

<strong>Proverbs 16:7</strong><br>
“When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.”<br><br>

This passage teaches us that when our lives are pleasing to God, He does wonderful things on our behalf. One of those blessings is divine peace—He takes those who are our enemies and causes them to be at peace with us. This doesn't mean that enemies cease to exist, but rather that God restrains them. Even if they still harbor ill will, they are compelled to choose peace over conflict and destruction.<br><br>

Pleasing God is the key to increasing "more and more" in every area of life (<strong>1 Thessalonians 4:1</strong>). If you desire to seek and find God, you must also strive to please Him. We please the Father through our giving, our prayer life, fasting, and a commitment to doing His will. As we align our walk with His desires, our path shines brighter and brighter.<br><br>

In <strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>, we are commanded to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. When this becomes our primary focus, all the "things" we need are added unto us. Prioritize God's pleasure, and He will handle your battles and your provisions.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYERS</strong><br>
My Father my God, cause me to please You in the name of Jesus.<br>
My Father my God, increase me more and more in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>Worship with us this Sunday @ FACE TO FACE ASSEMBLY, 6:30 AM</strong>

<strong>GOD’S LOVE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Romans 5:8</strong><br>
“But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”<br><br>

God’s love is not ordinary love. It is not based on feelings, performance, or what we deserve. The Bible reveals that Christ died for us while we were yet sinners; He loved us before we changed, before we repented, and even at our worst. This is the definition of real love.<br><br>

While human love often depends on being pleased or treated well, God’s love reached out to us even when we were far from Him. In <strong>Jeremiah 31:3</strong>, He declares, “I have loved thee with an everlasting love.” Everlasting means it never ends, never grows weak, and never changes with time. Though friends and people may fail or disappoint you, God’s love remains constant.<br><br>

The ultimate proof of this love is found in <strong>John 3:16</strong>—the sacrifice of His only begotten Son. The cross is the eternal evidence of your value. When you truly understand God’s love, you stop begging for acceptance and move away from living in fear or doubting your worth.<br><br>

God’s love provides you with security, identity, and peace—not because you are perfect, but because He is love (<strong>1 John 4:16</strong>). Rest in the assurance that you are cherished by the Almighty today.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, Thank You for loving me with an everlasting love. Help me to rest in Your love daily in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>PERILOUS TIMES</strong><br><br>

<strong>2 Timothy 3:1</strong><br>
“This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.”<br><br>

The word "perilous" means dangerous, hard, stressful, and troubling. The Bible does not say perilous times <em>might</em> come; it says they <em>shall</em> come. Apostle Paul warned that in these times, men would be lovers of themselves, covetous, proud, unholy, and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Looking around today, we see these truths manifesting as wickedness increases and the fear of God diminishes.<br><br>

As Christians, we should not be surprised or panic. Jesus already told us that as iniquity abounds, the love of many would grow cold (<strong>Matthew 24:12</strong>). Perilous times are not a signal to run away from God, but a sign to hold tighter to His Word. We are instructed to continue in the things we have learned and been assured of (<strong>2 Timothy 3:14</strong>).<br><br>

In these difficult seasons, our responsibility is to stand on the Word, live in holiness, pray without ceasing, and refuse to follow the crowd or water down the truth. Our prayer should not just be for the removal of the times, but for the grace to remain standing.<br><br>

Perilous times are certain, but God’s grace is always greater. No matter how dark the world becomes, the grace of God is sufficient to keep you and your household sanctified and secure.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, give me grace to stand with Your Word. Sanctify me and my household daily in Jesus' Name. Amen.
</p>
