  <strong>PRAY FOR YOUR LOVED ONES</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Philippians 2:27</strong><br>
  “For indeed he was sick nigh unto death:
  but God had mercy on him;
  and not on him only,
  but on me also,
  lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.”<br><br>

  The Lord is placing a burden of prayer upon your heart today.
  This is not merely a word for your comfort;
  it is a divine strategy.<br><br>

  The mercy that spared Paul a double grief
  is the same mercy we must now invoke
  for those we love.
  Hear this by the Spirit:
  your intercession can be the barrier
  that stands between your loved one
  and sorrow upon sorrow.<br><br>

  Think of someone in your life right now,
  a child, a parent, a spouse, or a dear friend,
  who is walking through a valley.
  Perhaps they are sick in body,
  weary in soul,
  or shaken in faith.<br><br>

  Like Epaphroditus,
  they are “nigh unto death”
  in some area of their life.
  Your natural response may be to worry,
  to fear,
  or to grieve what may come next.
  But the Lord is shifting your posture today.<br><br>

  He is calling you beyond anxiety
  and into authority;
  beyond tears
  and into triumphant prayer.<br><br>

  God’s mercy to one person
  is often His mercy to another.
  When God healed Epaphroditus,
  He was also sparing Paul
  the crushing weight of compounded grief.<br><br>

  Your loved one’s breakthrough
  is your safeguard.
  Their healing
  is your protection
  from a second wave of sorrow.<br><br>

  Your prayer for them, therefore,
  is also a prayer for your own heart,
  your own peace,
  and your own future.<br><br>

  Today, do not merely worry about those you love;
  war on their behalf.
  Pray fervently that God shows them
  continual mercy:
  mercy in their health,
  mercy in their decisions,
  mercy in their trials,
  so that their victory becomes a wall
  around your own soul,
  lest you have sorrow upon sorrow.<br><br>

  Pray with understanding.
  You are not a bystander to their struggle;
  you are a guardian of God’s mercy over their life.
  Your prayers pull heaven’s intervention
  into their circumstances,
  and that intervention creates
  a holy boundary around your own
  emotional and spiritual well-being.<br><br>

  Do not grow weary.
  The mercy you seek for them
  is the same mercy preserving you.
  As you stand in the gap,
  you are activating a covenant principle:
  one mercy cancels two sorrows.<br><br>

  Believe it.
  As God shows them mercy,
  He is also showing mercy to you,
  sparing you both
  from a grief too heavy to bear.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  show us mercy.
  Swallow up every plan of sorrow upon sorrow
  assigned against me and my loved ones.
  Let Your mercy prevail in our lives,
  in Jesus’ name.
  Amen.

  <strong>YOU SHALL NOT WEEP</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Luke 7:13</strong><br>
  “And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her,
  and said unto her, Weep not.”<br><br>

  The Lord has a prophetic word for your spirit.
  Hear it clearly:
  in the last days of this year,
  you shall not weep.<br><br>

  This is not a wish.
  It is a declaration from the throne of heaven.
  It is the same word of power Jesus spoke
  to the widow of Nain,
  and it is spoken to you now
  by the Spirit of God.<br><br>

  That widow’s weeping was justified.
  Her loss was real,
  and her future looked hopeless.
  Yet, into her procession of despair,
  Jesus stepped in
  and issued a command
  that changed the atmosphere of death.<br><br>

  He did not ask her to stop crying.
  He commanded her to stop.
  Why?
  Because His “weep not”
  was not based on her situation,
  but on His authority
  and His immediate intention to act.<br><br>

  This is your portion.
  The Lord sees the source of your past tears.
  He has compassion on you.
  And He is now decreeing
  that your seasons of sorrow are cancelled.<br><br>

  His “weep not” is a prophetic freeze
  on every plan of the enemy
  to bring you into mourning.
  It is a divine injunction
  against loss,
  against hopelessness,
  and against despair.<br><br>

  You shall not weep
  because the Lord of Life
  is stepping into your procession.
  He is touching what others declared finished.
  He is commanding a turnaround
  where doors were shut.<br><br>

  Your tears are being replaced
  with testimony.
  The same voice that commands your tears to dry
  is also commanding dead hopes to rise.<br><br>

  Receive this word by faith.
  Walk into the coming year
  with assurance
  that the Lord’s compassion
  has already gone ahead of you.<br><br>

  The last days of this year
  are marked not by mourning,
  but by miracles;
  not by lamentation,
  but by restoration.<br><br>

  You shall not weep,
  for the God of all comfort
  has spoken it.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I declare that I shall not weep
  in the remaining days of 2025.
  Let every cause of sorrow be terminated.
  I receive joy, restoration, and testimony,
  in Jesus’ mighty name.
  Amen.

  <strong>SOMETIMES “NO” IS THE ANSWER</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Matthew 26:39</strong><br>
  “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
  nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”<br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 55:8</strong><br>
  “For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
  neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.”<br><br>

  We often pray expecting a yes.
  We plan around a yes.
  But God, who is perfectly wise and just,
  sometimes answers with no.<br><br>

  God’s no is not rejection;
  it is redirection.
  It is not proof that He does not love you,
  but evidence that He loves you too much
  to give you what will harm you
  or interfere with His righteous purpose.<br><br>

  Even Jesus, in the garden of Gethsemane,
  asked the Father if there was another way.
  The answer was no —
  not because the Father lacked love,
  but because divine justice required
  a greater yes: the salvation of mankind.<br><br>

  When God says no,
  it does not mean He ignored your prayer.
  It means He sees what you cannot see.
  His no is often mercy in disguise,
  protecting you from traps,
  saving you from settling for less,
  and preparing you for something far greater
  than what you asked for.<br><br>

  Do not interpret God’s no as abandonment.
  His no is still an answer.
  It is His way of saying,
  “I am just.
  I am wise.
  I am working all things together
  for your good and My glory.”<br><br>

  Your breakthrough is not cancelled;
  it is being curated
  by divine justice.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I believe that all things are working for my good.
  Teach me to understand You better.
  I submit my will to Yours,
  in Jesus’ Name, Amen.
</p>
