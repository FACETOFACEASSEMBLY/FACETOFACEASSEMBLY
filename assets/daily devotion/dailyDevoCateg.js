<strong>KNOCKING ON THE RIGHT DOOR</strong><br><br>

<strong>Isaiah 45:2</strong><br>
“I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron.”<br><br>

Imagine a man visiting a friend but knocking on the wrong apartment door. He knocks for a long time, waits, and knocks again, but his friend is in a different room waiting for him. The problem isn't the building or the timing; the problem is the wrong door. When you knock on the wrong door, you waste your time, your season, and your finances. Many people are sincere, but they are struggling because they are knocking on doors God never opened for them.<br><br>

When God goes before you, He ensures you do not waste your life on the wrong opportunities. He leads you to the right place at the right time. We see this with the disciples who labored all night and caught nothing. They were experienced fishermen, yet they were unsuccessful until Jesus gave them divine direction: “Cast the net on the right side of the ship.” The sea, the boat, and the nets were the same, but the direction changed. Success is often not about working harder, but about working under divine instruction.<br><br>

This year, you must refuse to move without God. Do not start a project, enter a relationship, or make an investment without His leading. Some doors look attractive but are empty, while others look small but carry your destiny. God knows the right people, the right business, and the perfect timing for your lifting.<br><br>

Ask God to show you the right door today. One right door, opened by God, can change your life forever. Refuse to waste your strength and resources on what God has not sanctioned.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, lead me to the right door this year. I refuse to waste my time, season, and finances. Lead me by Your Spirit in Jesus’ name. Amen.

<strong>THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 80:1</strong><br>
“Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.”<br><br>

The revelation of God as Shepherd is one of the greatest mysteries of covenant security. He is the Shepherd of Israel—the One who leads, protects, preserves, and causes His flock to triumph. A walk with the Shepherd is a victorious walk; when we truly follow Him, we walk a path free from confusion, lack, and abandonment. It is a walk where nothing is missing and nothing is broken.<br><br>

Jesus demonstrated this system in <strong>Luke 22:35</strong> when He asked His disciples if they lacked anything when He sent them out without purse or scrip. Their answer was, “Nothing.” This is the Shepherd’s system: when He leads, provision follows. When He sends, supply answers. When He guides, preservation is guaranteed.<br><br>

<strong>Psalm 23:1</strong> declares, “The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.” Notice it does not say "I may not want." When the Lord is truly your Shepherd, fear loses its voice and lack loses its power. Goodness and mercy become your daily companions. May the good Lord shepherd you all the days of your life.<br><br>

Declare this boldly: The Lord is my Shepherd. I shall not want. I shall not lack. I shall not be stranded. I walk in divine guidance, divine provision, and divine preservation in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>THURSDAY 19TH FEBRUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>OH LORD GIVE ME A NEW SONG</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 40:3</strong><br>
“And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.”<br><br>

Before a breakthrough appears publicly, Heaven often shifts something internally. Hope rises, and the burdens that once felt heavy begin to feel lighter—this is the beginning of a new song. A new song is not just about music; it is about testimony. It is the spiritual evidence that God has moved on your behalf.<br><br>

When God lifts you from the pit of despair, He places a new sound within you. He becomes your song, your strength, and your salvation. When God does a new thing, your declaration changes to: “The Lord has done it; my season has changed; mercy has spoken for me and my family.” Often, you don’t even realize the song has changed until you look back and see that you survived what was meant to destroy you.<br><br>

Beloved, you may still be in the middle of your story, but do not worry. The God who gave Hannah a song of triumph will give you yours as well. The God who turned David’s mourning into dancing remains the same today. To everyone who is tired: a new song is coming to you very soon in the name of the Lord.<br><br>

When God finishes what He has started in your life, people will hear of it and declare with you that this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, give me a new song; turn my mourning into dancing in Jesus’ name. Amen.
</p>
