  <strong>THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM</strong><br><br>

  Today, in our time of praise, God’s Spirit is showing us the promise of His wisdom. Our "Alleluia" comes from a heart that has found the main thing needed in life: God’s own wisdom. This wisdom makes you see clearly when others are lost. It sets you apart and strengthens and lengthens your life.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 4:7</strong><br>
  “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.”<br><br>

  Wisdom is the most important thing. It is not just being smart—it is thinking and seeing the way God sees. The Bible teaches that if you lack wisdom, simply ask God, and He will give it freely and generously (James 1:5). This wisdom made Daniel and his friends ten times better than all the wise men of Babylon (Daniel 1:20). It is the wisdom that builds your house and establishes your family (Proverbs 24:3). It brings long life, honor, and peace (Proverbs 3:16).<br><br>

  But you must go to the right source to receive it. Glory to God who owns all wisdom and gives it to His children. Jesus showed this wisdom daily—never confused, never without an answer. Scripture reveals: “But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom” (1 Corinthians 1:30 KJV). Jesus *is* the wisdom of God. To have Him is to have heaven’s solution for every situation—your home, your work, and your life.<br><br>

  He became like us so we could receive God’s wisdom. Your “Alleluia” today is not the cry of someone confused, but the shout of someone with access to the mind of Christ. You are not navigating life alone. You have a Father who gives wisdom freely and a Savior who *is* wisdom. Ask, and you will receive.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father My God, I ask You now for Your wisdom. Forgive every foolish way in me and give me the mind of Christ. Let Your wisdom make me ten times better in all I do. Let it build my home, guide my decisions, and lengthen my life. I break every chain of confusion and error. Turn my darkness into direction and my questions into clarity. I receive Your wisdom now, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>GOD BLESS YOU!</strong>

  <strong>THE SPIRIT OF WEALTH AND RICHES</strong><br><br>

  <strong>2 Corinthians 8:9</strong><br>
  “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.”<br><br>

  Today, in our Season of Alleluia, the Spirit of God lifts the veil on the covenant of divine prosperity. Our shout of “Alleluia” is the sound of a heart that has discovered true riches—wealth that begins in the spirit and transforms the wilderness of lack into a fertile field of abundance.<br><br>

  True riches are first spiritual, then natural. Scripture declares: “Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever” (Psalm 112:3). This is the wealth of a peaceful home, children walking in truth, and health sustained by God’s hand. Wealth and riches are twin blessings that follow the covenant keeper.<br><br>

  Before you can walk in overflow, you must return to the Source. It is the outpouring of the Spirit that changes your landscape: “Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field…” (Isaiah 32:15). God does not just give things; He gives His Spirit, and His Spirit gives power, wisdom, ideas, and opportunities.<br><br>

  “But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth” (Deuteronomy 8:18). When God gives, He gives completely. Wealth has a voice that commands honour. Joseph of Arimathaea, a rich man, walked into the presence of authority and boldly asked for the body of Jesus (Matthew 27:57). Wealth speaks where mere desire is silent.<br><br>

  Believer, this is your inheritance. Christ became poor so that you might be rich in grace, favour, and divine provision. Your “Alleluia” today is not a cry from lack but a declaration from covenant abundance. You are not a beggar—you are a child of the King. Align with your Source and command your environment to reflect your spiritual riches in Christ.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father and my God, I return to You as my only Source. Pour out Your Spirit upon my life, my mind, and the work of my hands. Let every wilderness in my finances, health, and family be transformed into a fruitful field and a forest of abundance. I receive the spirit of wealth and riches—the divine power to create, gather, and enjoy Your provision in peace. I break every curse of poverty, debt, and failure, and I walk in covenant prosperity, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

  <strong>I AM A MAN UNDER AUTHORITY</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Matthew 8:6-9</strong><br>
  “Lord, my servant lies at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.” And Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.” The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”<br><br>

  Today, we step deeper into our Season of Alleluia by unlocking a profound mystery — the mystery of divine authority. Our shout of “Alleluia” is not only in gratitude for what God has done, but in recognition of the position He has given us to enforce His will on earth.<br><br>

  The centurion’s faith astonished Jesus because he understood the principle of delegated authority. He said, “I am a man under authority.” His ability to command came from the power he was submitted to. Because he was under authority, he could speak with authority.<br><br>

  Beloved, this is your kingdom identity. You are not ordinary, and you are not operating alone. You are a man, a woman, UNDER AUTHORITY — the supreme authority of Jesus Christ. And because you are under His Lordship, His authority flows through you. You speak in the power of His name.<br><br>

  Scripture declares: “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God…” (John 1:12). As a child of God, you carry divine authority. Jesus entrusted you with power over all devils (Luke 9:1) and with the ability to command mountains to move (Mark 11:23).<br><br>

  Just as Jesus stood at the tomb of Lazarus and issued a command (John 11:43), you also have been empowered to speak to situations in His name:<br><br>

  · You can call FORTH favor, connections, and prosperity, and they must come.<br>
  · You can command TO GO sickness, poverty, shame, and oppression, and they must flee.<br><br>

  Your words are not empty. When aligned with God’s Word, they become spiritual mandates. Heaven backs them. Angels respond to them. Darkness fears them. The centurion knew that authority makes words powerful — and when you speak in the name of Jesus, all of heaven enforces your declaration.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father My God, I declare that I am a man under Your authority. Today, I call forth my inheritance of health, prosperity, favor, and peace. I command every force of lack, sickness, and shame to depart from my life and my household. My “Alleluia” is the shout of a victorious soldier in Your army. As I have believed, so let it be unto me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
