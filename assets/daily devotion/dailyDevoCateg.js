    prayer: `<p>**FORBID SATAN TO ENTER YOU**  

“**And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.**” — John 13:27

When Satan entered Judas, everything about his destiny changed. A man who once walked with Jesus became the instrument of betrayal. Judas did not begin as a traitor; he began as a disciple. But along the journey, he opened a small door — a door of greed, offense, and pride — and Satan entered.

Satan never forces his way into a person’s life; he gains access through sin and weakness. When anger lingers, when jealousy grows, when offense is nurtured, Satan waits patiently at the door. He looks for opportunities through thoughts, emotions, and choices. That is why Paul warned, “**Neither give place to the devil**” (Ephesians 4:27).

You must actively forbid Satan from entering you. Guard your heart with diligence. Pay attention to the thoughts you allow, the emotions you entertain, and the attitudes you permit. Bitterness, envy, and unforgiveness are open doors that give darkness legal access.

When Satan enters, he does not come to visit; he comes to kill, steal, and destroy. Judas lost his peace, purpose, and even his life. But when you shut every door against the enemy, you preserve your destiny and protect your walk with God.

If God uses you, He blesses you. But if Satan uses you, he destroys and dumps you. I pray for you and your household today — Satan will find no space, no opening, and no foothold in your life, in Jesus’ mighty name. Amen.

<br><br>
**PRAYER:** <br>
My Father, my God, I shut every door I may have unknowingly opened to the enemy. Let Your light expose every dark place in me. I reject anger, bitterness, and pride. I forbid Satan to enter me. Fill me with Your Spirit and keep my heart steadfast in Your truth, in Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>

    prayer: `<p>**CONFIDENCE**  

“**And this is the confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us.**” — 1 John 5:14

Confidence in God is the deep assurance that He is faithful, His promises are true, and He will never fail. Even in times of uncertainty, trials, or when we feel distant from Him, our trust in God must remain unshaken.

Many people hesitate to approach God because of fear, guilt, or doubt. Yet, the Bible encourages us to come boldly before His throne. Confidence in God means knowing that He welcomes us, hears us, and cares for us. When we ask according to His will, He answers in alignment with His perfect plan for our lives.

“**Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.**” — Hebrews 10:35

Sometimes, we pray and still worry about whether God will answer. But this scripture reassures us that He hears and responds — though not always in the way or time we expect. True confidence in God is trusting that His response is always the best for us.

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego demonstrated this unwavering confidence when they faced the fiery furnace. They declared that even if God did not deliver them, they would still trust Him. That is the essence of faith — trusting in His sovereignty, not just His miracles.

Confidence in God silences fear and strengthens faith. It turns worry into worship and doubt into assurance. Hold on to your confidence, for God never fails those who trust Him.

<br>
<br>
**PRAYER:** <br>
My Father, my God, I have confidence in You. Hear and answer me according to Your will. Strengthen my faith and let my trust in You never fade. In Jesus’ mighty name, Amen.</p>`

    prayer: `<p>**I WILL OVERTURN, OVERTURN, OVERTURN**  

“I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.” — Ezekiel 21:27

When God says, “I will overturn,” it is a promise of divine intervention. It means He will dismantle every order, power, or person standing in the way of His purpose. God’s overturning is not random; it is a deliberate act to restore what belongs to His chosen ones.

Zephaniah 3:19 reveals the meaning behind this promise: “I will undo all that afflict thee.” The word “undo” carries the same power as “overturn.” God breaks the hold of the oppressor, silences the voice of affliction, and restores honour to those who have been shamed.

When God begins to overturn, it may look like chaos, but it is divine construction in motion. He removes wrong people from right positions and replaces them with those He has chosen. He overturns delay, disappointment, and demonic influence until His will is fully accomplished.

God’s overturning is His way of undoing affliction and restoring glory. When He begins to move, no force on earth or in hell can resist His hand. Wait for Him — He will not stop until He has placed you where you truly belong.

<br>
<br>
PRAYER: <br>
My Father, my God, overturn every affliction and opposition in my life. Replace shame with honour and cause me to rise where I have been cast down. Establish me in the place You have prepared for me, in Jesus’ mighty name, Amen.</p>`
