  <strong>RIGHT THINKING</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Luke 1:28–37</strong><br>
  “And the angel came in unto Mary, and said,
  Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee:
  blessed art thou among women.<br><br>

  And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,
  and bring forth a son,
  and shalt call his name JESUS.<br><br>

  Then said Mary unto the angel,
  How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?<br><br>

  And the angel answered and said unto her,
  The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
  and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee:
  therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
  shall be called the Son of God.<br><br>

  And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth,
  she hath also conceived a son in her old age:
  and this is the sixth month with her,
  who was called barren.<br><br>

  For with God nothing shall be impossible.”<br><br>

  Immediately, Mary’s thinking changed.
  She moved from questioning
  to submission,
  from limitation
  to alignment.
  And she declared,
  <strong>“Be it unto me according to thy word.”</strong><br><br>

  Right thinking positions a man
  for divine manifestation.
  Until your thinking changes,
  your outcome remains the same.<br><br>

  The prodigal son also experienced
  a shift in thinking.
  First, he demanded his inheritance.
  Later, after losing everything,
  he thought again and said,
  “I will arise and go to my father.”
  That single thought
  restored his destiny.<br><br>

  <strong>Ephesians 3:20</strong><br>
  God is able to do exceedingly abundantly
  above all that we ask or think.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 23:7</strong><br>
  “For as a man thinketh in his heart,
  so is he.”<br><br>

  Your life will always move
  in the direction of your dominant thoughts.
  Think rightly,
  align your mind with God’s Word,
  and become a better version of yourself.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  align my thoughts with Your Word.
  Remove every limitation in my mind,
  and let my thinking produce Your will
  in my life.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>JOY IS COMING</strong><br><br>

  Everyone desires joy.
  Everyone wants a heart full of gladness,
  a life that overflows with laughter and peace,
  no matter the season.<br><br>

  The Lord Himself is the giver of joy.
  He hears the prayers of your heart
  and answers in ways that fill your mouth with laughter
  and your spirit with delight.
  Just as He visited Zacharias,
  He will visit you with the assurance
  that your appointed joy is on the way.<br><br>

  <strong>Luke 1:13–14</strong><br><br>

  <strong>John 15:11</strong><br>
  “These things have I spoken unto you,
  that my joy might remain in you,
  and that your joy might be full.”<br><br>

  The Scripture also declares:<br>
  <strong>Isaiah 12:3</strong><br>
  “Therefore with joy shall ye draw water
  out of the wells of salvation.”<br><br>

  However, joy can be stolen.
  The Bible shows us that when joy withers,
  everything else begins to languish.<br>
  <strong>Joel 1:12</strong><br><br>

  You must guard your joy.
  Avoid anyone
  and any situation
  that drains your joy.
  Protect the well within you.<br><br>

  No one accidentally lives a joyful life
  in a sorrowful world.
  But as you fix your heart
  on the Father of lights,
  I declare today:
  <strong>Your joy is coming!</strong><br><br>

  God is restoring every lost celebration,
  filling your mouth with laughter,
  and causing your well to overflow.
  Your heart shall be light,
  and your days shall be glad,
  in Jesus’ Name.
  Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  restore my joy this day.
  Let every stolen gladness return,
  and let my heart overflow with Your joy.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>BUILD YOUR CHILDREN</strong><br><br>

  Until your children succeed,
  you have not succeeded.<br><br>

  Before you build houses for your children,
  build your children.<br>
  <strong>Isaiah 54:13</strong><br><br>

  Invest in your children.
  Inculcate norms,
  values,
  morals,
  standards,
  discipline,
  knowledge,
  wisdom,
  truth,
  understanding,
  and prayers into their lives.<br>
  <strong>Proverbs 23:23</strong><br><br>

  If you fail to build your children
  before building houses for them,
  they may sell those houses
  you laboured to build,
  even with your grave still in it.<br><br>

  Food for thought.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 22:6</strong><br>
  “Train up a child in the way he should go:
  and when he is old,
  he will not depart from it.”<br><br>

  Catch them young.
  Catch them young.
  Catch them young.<br><br>

  When children are raised from the cradle
  with godly values,
  it shapes their system,
  their character,
  and their destiny.
  These principles follow them through life,
  sharpening their decisions
  and forming their success story.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 144:12</strong><br><br>

  What is planted in them today
  becomes what stands for them tomorrow.
  And in turn,
  they will pass these same values
  to their own children,
  and the lineage continues beautifully.<br><br>

  <strong>Joel 1:3</strong><br><br>

  Before you build houses for your children,
  build your children.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I decree that my children
  are for signs and wonders.
  Let them walk in truth,
  wisdom,
  and divine purpose.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.<br>
  <strong>Isaiah 8:18</strong>
