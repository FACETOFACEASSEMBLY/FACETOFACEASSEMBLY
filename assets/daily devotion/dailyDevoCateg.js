<strong>I AM UNSTOPPABLE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Jeremiah 1:19</strong><br>
“And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.”<br><br>

When you say, “I am unstoppable,” you are not speaking of your own power. You are declaring that you are like the wind, moved by the Spirit of God. As Gamaliel said in the Acts of the Apostles, if a purpose is of God, no one can stop it.<br><br>

Joseph was given a dream as a boy. His brothers, Potiphar’s wife, and even a prison cell all tried to stop that dream, but they could not. God made him unstoppable.<br><br>

Even our Lord Jesus faced resistance from Herod, the Pharisees, the cross, and the grave. Yet He was unstoppable. The resurrection proved that nothing could hold Him down.<br><br>

To be truly unstoppable, you must be rooted in the Lord.<br>
• You must rely on the power in His name.<br>
• You must trust Him for victory no matter the turbulence.<br>
• You must continually declare His Word.<br><br>

As Paul said, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” Your strength is a gift from Him.<br><br>

“If God be for us, who can be against us?”<br><br>

Connect your purpose to His will. Anchor your journey in His strength. When you do this, you are no longer just a person with a dream — you become a vessel of divine purpose that hell itself cannot overcome. Your path is ordained, your protection is assured, and your end is certain in Him.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, today I declare by Your power that I am unstoppable. Strengthen me with Your divine power, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>YOUR JOY CAN BE FULL</strong><br><br>

<strong>John 15:11</strong><br>
“These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.”<br><br>

Jesus spoke His words to us for a clear and wonderful purpose, so that His own joy would take root in our hearts, and so that our joy would be made full. This is not a joy that comes from our things or our plans. It is a joy that comes from His life living in us.<br><br>

Jesus said these things so that His joy would remain. To remain means to stay, to last, to be unshaken. If your joy is His joy, then it cannot be taken from you by the world, for it is rooted in heaven.<br><br>

A joy that is full has no empty space for fear or defeat. It is not a half-full cup, easily spilled. It is filled to the top and overflowing. This fullness comes from one place — abiding in His words and in His love. When you hold tightly to His promises, you are holding tightly to your joy. Your circumstances are not the source; He is the source.<br><br>

Do not let the thief steal what Jesus has given you. The enemy wants you to believe your joy depends on your family, your money, your health, or your success. But Jesus says your joy depends on Him alone. If you connect your joy to anything else, it will be divided and can be broken. But a joy connected to Christ is sealed and sure.<br><br>

Today, choose to receive His Word not as a burden, but as the keeper of your joy. Every command and every promise is a guardian of your heart’s gladness. All through 2026, let this be your truth: nothing shall separate me from the joy of the Lord, for it is His joy in me — and His joy is full, permanent, and victorious.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, let the joy of Jesus remain in me and be my strength. All through this year, let my joy be full, untouched by the world, and rooted in Your eternal love. I declare my joy is complete in You, in Jesus’ Name, Amen.

  <strong>SANCTIFY ME WHOLLY</strong><br><br>

  <strong>1 Thessalonians 5:23</strong><br>
  “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”<br><br>

  To be sanctified is to be set apart for God’s special use.
  And God does not want just a part of you—He wants all of you.
  “Wholly” means entirely, completely:
  spirit, soul, and body.<br><br>

  Many people try to give God their spirit on one day,
  but keep their soul—their mind, will, and emotions—for their own plans.
  They offer prayers,
  yet withhold their habits, disciplines, and physical choices.
  This is not sanctification; it is bargaining.
  A divided life cannot carry the peace of God,
  and a divided heart cannot shine with His glory.<br><br>

  God is the God of peace, not confusion.
  His peace flows when every room of your life
  is surrendered to His authority.
  Your spirit, your thoughts, your decisions,
  and even your body must come under His lordship.
  There is no lasting peace
  when part of you is still held back,
  afraid of what full surrender might cost.
  Just as a lamp cannot be half-lit,
  you cannot be half-sanctified
  and still fulfill your divine purpose.<br><br>

  The prayer for sanctification
  is a prayer of total surrender.
  It says,
  “Lord, every part of me belongs to You.
  I am not my own.
  Preserve me, keep me,
  and make me blameless,
  not by my strength,
  but by Your grace working in my whole being.”
  This is how a believer is prepared,
  not fragmented,
  but complete and filled with God.<br><br>

  Stop offering God fragments.
  He asks for the whole offering.
  Let there be no hidden room in your heart
  where doubts, fears, or secret sins are stored.
  Open every door,
  and allow the God of peace
  to sanctify you wholly.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, My God,
  I come to You with open hands.
  I hold nothing back.
  Sanctify me wholly—
  my spirit, my soul, and my body.
  Set every part of me apart
  for Your use completely.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.
