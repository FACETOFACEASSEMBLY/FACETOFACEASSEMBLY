<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>


<strong>HELP FROM EVERY DIRECTION</strong><br><br>

<strong>Genesis 13:14–15</strong><br>
“And the LORD said unto Abram... Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.”<br><br>

When God wanted to bless Abraham, He told him to look in every direction: north, south, east, and west. This instruction was a prophetic symbol that God’s help, blessing, and favor can come from every direction of life. God does not run out of channels to lift a man; He can raise a helper from any corner of the earth.<br><br>

Scripture shows us that God often works through men to help men. Though He is sovereign, He delights in using human vessels to execute His will. Just as Aaron and Hur supported Moses, Joseph preserved nations, and Barnabas strengthened Paul, God’s help often wears a human face.<br><br>

The Bible speaks of four major directions and describes gates on each side of the city of God (<strong>Ezekiel 48:30–35</strong>; <strong>Revelation 21:12–13</strong>). This signifies that from every direction, there are open gates of help, favor, and destiny. You may not know where your help will come from, but God does.<br><br>

The same God who sent angels to Abraham, ravens to Elijah, and wise men to Jesus can stir hearts from every corner of the earth to favor you. Trust Him to open the gates of help from places you least expect.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYERS</strong><br>
My Father, My God, open to me and my family the four gates, and let helpers and Your blessings flow to us, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

This instruction was a prophetic symbol that God’s help, blessing, and favor can come from every corner of life. God never runs out of channels to lift a man; He can raise a helper from any part of the earth.<br><br>

Though God is sovereign and all-powerful, He delights in using human vessels to execute His will. We see this throughout scripture: Aaron and Hur helped Moses when his hands grew weak, Joseph preserved nations, and Barnabas was sent to strengthen Paul. Truly, God’s help often wears a human face.<br><br>

The Bible describes open gates on every side of the city of God—north, south, east, and west (<strong>Ezekiel 48:30–35</strong>; <strong>Revelation 21:12–13</strong>). This means that from every direction, there are open gates of help, favor, and destiny available to you. You may not know exactly where your breakthrough will come from, but God does.<br><br>

The same God who sent ravens to Elijah and wise men to Jesus can stir hearts from the least expected places to favor you. Trust that He is moving across every direction of the earth to bring your help to you in this season.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYERS</strong><br>
My Father, My God, open to me and my family the four gates, and let helpers and Your blessings flow to us from every direction, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>WHEN YOUR WAY PLEASES GOD</strong><br><br>

<strong>Proverbs 16:7</strong><br>
“When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.”<br><br>

This passage teaches us that when our lives are pleasing to God, He does wonderful things on our behalf. One of those blessings is divine peace—He takes those who are our enemies and causes them to be at peace with us. This doesn't mean that enemies cease to exist, but rather that God restrains them. Even if they still harbor ill will, they are compelled to choose peace over conflict and destruction.<br><br>

Pleasing God is the key to increasing "more and more" in every area of life (<strong>1 Thessalonians 4:1</strong>). If you desire to seek and find God, you must also strive to please Him. We please the Father through our giving, our prayer life, fasting, and a commitment to doing His will. As we align our walk with His desires, our path shines brighter and brighter.<br><br>

In <strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>, we are commanded to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. When this becomes our primary focus, all the "things" we need are added unto us. Prioritize God's pleasure, and He will handle your battles and your provisions.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYERS</strong><br>
My Father my God, cause me to please You in the name of Jesus.<br>
My Father my God, increase me more and more in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br>
