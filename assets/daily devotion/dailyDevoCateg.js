  <strong>NO ONE WILL TURN MY GLORY TO SHAME</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 4:2</strong><br>
  “O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?
  how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing?”<br><br>

  Glory is God’s investment in a man. Shame is the enemy’s agenda
  against that investment. Many people do not lack destiny;
  they lack the preservation of glory. David’s cry in Psalm 4:2
  is not weakness—it is spiritual awareness. He understood that
  glory can be attacked, questioned, delayed, or mocked,
  but it must never be surrendered.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 8:5</strong><br>
  God crowned man with glory and honour. This means glory is
  not accidental; it is divine placement.<br><br>

  David speaks as one conscious of his divine positioning.
  He says, “my glory,” acknowledging ownership,
  yet confronting those attempting to convert it into shame.
  This reveals a powerful spiritual principle:
  glory attracts contention. When God marks a man with glory,
  opposition rises to disgrace it.<br><br>

  Shame is not always the result of sin; sometimes it is warfare.
  The enemy’s objective is not just to stop you,
  but to make your glory look like failure.
  The turning of glory to shame often comes through
  delays that resemble denial,
  mockery from those who once applauded,
  pressure to compromise identity for acceptance,
  and situations designed to make you doubt God’s Word.<br><br>

  But David understood a higher truth:
  men may attempt, but they cannot succeed without permission.
  No man has the authority to rewrite what God authored.
  If God called it glory, no situation has the power to rename it shame.<br><br>

  <strong>Job 29:20</strong><br>
  “My glory was fresh in me…”<br><br>

  I stand with God’s promise and declare
  that my glory shall remain fresh,
  preserved, and defended by God Himself.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, I declare that my glory shall not be turned
  to shame. Preserve what You have invested in me.
  Defend my destiny, silence mockery,
  and let my glory remain fresh by Your power.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>THE MORE YOU STUDY, THE BETTER YOU BECOME</strong><br><br>

  Think of your faith like a house. A house needs a strong foundation and solid walls to
  stand firm. God’s Word is that foundation. When you neglect study, your spiritual life
  becomes vulnerable. Jesus warned that ignorance of Scripture and the power of God
  leads people into error.<br>
  <em>“Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.”</em>
  — Matthew 22:29<br><br>

  Studying the Bible is not only for pastors or teachers. It is essential for your daily
  life, your decisions, your growth, and your peace. A shallow Word produces a shaky
  faith, but deep study builds spiritual stability.<br><br>

  The best people in Scripture were always learning:<br><br>

  • The disciples did not only follow Jesus; they sat with Him, asked questions,
  and allowed Him to teach them how to live.<br><br>

  • Cornelius was a devout and praying man, yet he still needed understanding through
  Peter’s teaching (Acts 10).<br><br>

  • The Ethiopian official was reading the Scriptures, but understanding came only
  when Philip explained the Word to him (Acts 8:30–31).<br><br>

  • Even Jesus, as a child, was found in the temple listening, asking questions,
  and learning (Luke 2:46).<br><br>

  Here is the beautiful truth: what you learn is not meant to end with you.
  Jesus commanded us to teach others what we have been taught
  (Matthew 28:19–20). As long as you remain teachable, you remain useful in God’s hands.<br><br>

  Seek those who know the Word and learn from them.
  Study the Scriptures personally.
  Listen to sound teaching.
  And when understanding comes, be ready to share it with humility and love.
  This is how believers grow strong together.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, ignite in me a genuine hunger for Your Word.
  Open my understanding, strengthen my foundation,
  and help me grow through Your truth.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>KEEP BELIEVING</strong><br><br>

  There is a divine principle in the Kingdom: what hell has assigned to be permanent,
  God ordains to be temporary.<br>
  <em>“While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen:
  for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.”</em>
  — 2 Corinthians 4:18<br><br>

  Joseph understood this principle. He was betrayed, enslaved, and imprisoned for crimes
  he did not commit. He carried a God-given dream inside a man-made dungeon.
  His circumstances shouted “life sentence,” but heaven had already written
  “Prime Minister.”<br><br>

  <em>“Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon:
  and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.”</em>
  — Genesis 41:14<br><br>

  The prison is not just a place.<br>
  It is an assignment of delay.<br>
  It is a plot to bury a promise.<br>
  It is a system designed to make a man forget his destiny.<br><br>

  But throughout Scripture, God consistently rises to reverse the plots of the enemy.
  In Joseph’s life, when the enemy used the pit, slavery, and prison to destroy a dream,
  God used that same prison as the pathway to the palace.
  The place meant to break him became the platform that launched him.<br><br>

  <em>“And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this,
  there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
  Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled:
  only in the throne will I be greater than thou.”</em>
  — Genesis 41:39–40<br><br>

  Your delay may appear long, but it has an expiry date on God’s calendar.
  And God’s promotion always includes the authority to govern what once held you captive.
  God never brings you out without setting you over.<br><br>

  You are not stuck — you are in processing.
  The “hastily” of God can compress years of waiting into a single day
  of supernatural reversal.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, every prison assigned against my destiny must release me now.
  Let Your purpose for my life be established.
  I step out of delay and into divine fulfillment.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.<br><br>
</p>
