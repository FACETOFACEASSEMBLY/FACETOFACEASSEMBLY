<p><strong>COVER MY HEAD LORD</strong><br><br>

“O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.” — <strong>Psalm 140:7</strong><br><br>

In ancient warfare, the enemy aimed for the head first, because once the head is struck, the whole body collapses.  
The head represents authority, control, visibility, and destiny.<br><br>

David understood this mystery. He did not pray, “Lord, cover my sword,” or “cover my armor.”  
Instead, he declared, “Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle,” because survival and victory begin when the head is divinely shielded.<br><br>

When God covers your head, no arrow of destruction can penetrate your destiny.  
The head is the crown of your identity and the seat of your anointing.  
Kings were anointed on the head; priests were consecrated on the head; and the oil of divine favor flows from the head down to the whole body (<strong>Psalm 133:2</strong>).<br><br>

So when God covers your head, He protects more than your physical life — He preserves your authority, your glory, and your crown.<br><br>

The day of battle is not the day to trust in helmets made by men; it is the day to rely on the divine covering made by God.  
This covering may be invisible, but it is invincible — unseen by men, yet recognized by angels and feared by darkness.<br><br>

It is the shield that deflects unseen weapons of betrayal, envy, spiritual arrows, and sudden attacks.<br><br>

Your head carries your crown — keep it covered with obedience.<br><br>

Your head carries your oil — keep it pure and undefiled.<br><br>

Your head carries your destiny — ask God daily to cover it.<br><br>

Never walk uncovered in the spirit. Every man and woman of destiny needs divine head covering, for that is where the oil rests and where protection begins.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, cover my head in the day of battle. Preserve the oil of my calling and shield me from every strike of the enemy. Let my head never lack Your protection, and let my crown never fall. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>

    prayer: `<p><strong>GOD WORKS ACCORDING TO HIS NAME</strong><br><br>

“And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.” — <strong>Exodus 6:3</strong><br><br>

How God appears to you is how He answers you.  
Every name of God reveals a dimension of His power, and the revelation you carry determines the manifestation you experience.<br><br>

When He told Moses, “I AM THAT I AM,” He revealed Himself as the Self-Existent, All-Sufficient, Ever-Present God — the One who becomes whatever His people need Him to be (<strong>Exodus 3:14</strong>).<br><br>

When He manifests as the Consuming Fire, He burns away everything that stands against His purpose in your life (<strong>Hebrews 12:29</strong>).<br><br>

When He reveals Himself as the Faithful God, He reminds you that His promises never fail (<strong>Deuteronomy 7:9</strong>; <strong>1 Thessalonians 5:24</strong>).<br><br>

When He brings increase to your life, He is the God of Increase (<strong>1 Corinthians 3:6–7</strong>).<br><br>

When He opens your doors and the womb of your destiny, He is the God of Fruitfulness (<strong>Genesis 30:22–23</strong>).<br><br>

And when He forgives and cleanses your sins, He appears as the Merciful God (<strong>Daniel 9:9</strong>; <strong>1 John 1:9</strong>).<br><br>

The way God appears to you is the way He will answer you.  
May He appear to you today as the God Who Answers Prayer (<strong>Jeremiah 33:3</strong>; <strong>Psalm 65:2</strong>).<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, appear to me as the Merciful God, in Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>`

    prayer: `<p><strong>LIVING TO FULFIL SCRIPTURE</strong><br><br>

Everything about Jesus was written long before He came to earth.
Every detail of His life — from His birth in Bethlehem to His resurrection — was a fulfilment of prophecy.<br><br>

He was not searching for purpose; He was walking in what was written.
The prophets spoke, and He lived to manifest their words.<br><br>

Again and again, Jesus declared, “That the Scripture might be fulfilled,” showing that His steps were aligned with Heaven’s script.<br><br>

When Judas betrayed Him — it fulfilled Scripture.
When the soldiers cast lots for His robe — it fulfilled Scripture.
When He said, “I thirst” — it fulfilled Scripture.
When He bowed His head and gave up the ghost — it fulfilled all that was spoken concerning Him.<br><br>

Jesus lived with one objective: to make sure the Word written about Him came to pass.<br><br>

Child of God, you too are a written prophecy.
You are not accidental.
You are not random.
You are a divine script waiting to manifest.<br><br>

<strong>Psalm 40:7</strong> says,
“Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me.”<br><br>

There is a heavenly record that carries what God has written concerning your life — your destiny, your ministry, your impact, your success.
But these things only manifest when you walk in alignment with God’s will.<br><br>

You are not here to compete with men; you are here to complete prophecy.
You are not here to create your own plan; you are here to walk out God’s eternal plan.<br><br>

When you live in disobedience, you pause what is written about you.
When you walk in obedience, you activate it.<br><br>

Every act of faith moves prophecy closer.
Every act of carelessness pushes it further away.<br><br>

<strong>Romans 8:29–30</strong> reveals that those God foreknew, He predestined, called, justified, and glorified.
Your life is written — but your obedience determines how much of that script becomes visible on earth.<br><br>

Jesus fulfilled prophecy because He stayed aligned with the Father.
Your fulfilment also comes through alignment, not ambition.<br><br>

There is something written about your life that must not die unfulfilled.
You are the vessel chosen to prove that God’s Word never fails.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, help me to walk in Your will and fulfil every prophecy written concerning my life.
In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>`
