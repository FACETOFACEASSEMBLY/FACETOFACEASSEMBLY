  <strong>LORD, MAKE MY LIFE MEANINGFUL</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Genesis 45:13</strong><br>
  “And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt,
  and of all that ye have seen;
  and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.”<br><br>

  A man of God once taught
  that when a life lacks meaning,
  men will despise it
  and take it for granted.
  But when a life carries meaning,
  glorious things
  will be spoken of it.
  This truth is clearly seen
  in the life of Joseph.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 87:3</strong><br>
  “Glorious things are spoken of thee,
  O city of God.”<br><br>

  From birth,
  God marked Joseph’s life
  as meaningful.
  His dreams were great,
  but his journey was hard.
  His brothers hated him,
  sold him,
  and lied against him.
  He became a slave,
  then a prisoner.
  Yet, at every stage,
  God was with him.<br><br>

  The same gift
  that made his brothers jealous
  was the same gift
  that brought him before Pharaoh.
  A day came,
  just as God had spoken,
  when Joseph was lifted high.
  He told his brothers,
  <em>“Go and tell my father
  of all my glory.”</em>
  His life became so meaningful
  that nations were preserved
  and his family was restored.
  The same brothers
  who once despised him
  later bowed before him.<br><br>

  Your life may seem small right now.

  <strong>THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Romans 1:17</strong><br>
  “For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith:
  as it is written,
  The just shall live by faith.”<br><br>

  Faith is the currency
  of God’s kingdom.
  Just as money is required
  to transact in the natural,
  faith is required
  to receive in the spiritual.
  Faith is not a one-time experience;
  it is a daily necessity.
  God’s design is that you move
  from faith to faith,
  from one level of trust
  to another,
  from victory
  to greater victory.<br><br>

  Consider the woman
  with the issue of blood.
  She did not merely hope;
  she acted on what she believed.
  She pressed through the crowd
  with a faith so strong
  that it drew power
  from Jesus.
  And he said to her,
  <em>“Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole.”</em>
  <strong>Mark 5:34</strong><br><br>

  Faith is the bridge
  between your desire
  and God’s power
  to bring it to pass.
  When your faith is strong,
  you overcome temptations,
  challenges,
  and every obstacle
  that rises against you.<br><br>

  Faith, however,
  is not automatic.
  It can grow,
  and it can fail.
  That is why Jesus said to Peter,
  <em>“I have prayed for thee,
  that thy faith fail not.”</em>
  <strong>Luke 22:32</strong><br><br>

  Faith must be guarded.
  It grows by what you hear,
  what you meditate on,
  and what you allow
  into your heart.<br><br>

  <strong>Romans 10:17</strong><br>
  “So then faith cometh by hearing,
  and hearing by the word of God.”<br><br>

  If you do not guide
  what you hear,
  fear and doubt
  will weaken your faith.
  Feed your faith daily
  with God’s Word,
  and starve it
  of negative reports
  and unbelief.<br><br>

  In this year 2026,
  choose to live by faith
  and not by sight.
  Do not allow your past,
  your circumstances,
  or human opinions
  to define your reality.
  Let God’s Word
  shape your life.<br><br>

  Faith is the evidence
  of what you cannot yet see.
  It is your spiritual breath.
  Without faith,
  you cannot please God;
  but with faith,
  mountains move
  and doors open.
  A life of faith
  is a life of continual access
  to God’s goodness.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I declare that my faith
  will not fail.
  I choose to live by faith,
  trusting your Word
  in every situation.
  Let my life give you glory
  in this year 2026,
  in Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>MY GATE SHALL BE OPEN CONTINUALLY THIS YEAR 2026</strong><br><br>

  A gate is not just
  an entrance;
  it is a place of access,
  control,
  and opportunity.
  When a gate is shut,
  purpose is delayed
  and provision is blocked.
  But an open gate means favor,
  passage,
  and the unimpeded flow
  of God’s goodness.<br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 60:11</strong><br>
  “Therefore thy gates
  shall be open continually;
  they shall not be shut
  day nor night,
  that men may bring unto thee
  the forces of the Gentiles,
  and that their kings
  may be brought.”<br><br>

  God is intentional
  about open gates.
  He does not open them
  occasionally,
  he opens them continually.<br><br>

  <strong>Revelation 3:8</strong><br>
  “I know thy works:
  behold, I have set before thee
  an open door,
  and no man can shut it:
  for thou hast a little strength,
  and hast kept my word,
  and hast not denied my name.”<br><br>

  What God opens,
  no system,
  no past failure,
  no earthly power
  can close.
  God does not sponsor
  closed doors to destiny.
  What he provides
  is access,
  divine connections,
  and seasons of ingathering.
  Any thought that says
  “it is too late”
  or “it is impossible”
  did not come from him,
  and therefore
  you have authority
  to reject it.<br><br>

  The Psalmist
  understood this mystery
  when he declared
  prophetic authority
  over gates and doors.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 24:7</strong><br>
  “Lift up your heads,
  O ye gates;
  and be ye lift up,
  ye everlasting doors;
  and the King of glory
  shall come in.”<br><br>

  In this year 2026,
  do not accept
  the report of closed doors.
  Your past rejections
  cannot veto
  God’s decree
  of open access.
  Where you once saw a wall,
  see a gate.
  Where you once met delay,
  expect divine traffic —
  ideas,
  helpers,
  resources,
  and favor
  flowing toward you.
  Your gate is open
  continually,
  not occasionally,
  not seasonally,
  but continually.<br><br>

  Remember,
  a decree
  is a spiritual force.
  When you stand
  on God’s Word,
  circumstances must align
  with his promise.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  let my gates
  be open continually
  this year 2026.
  Let access replace delay,
  favor replace resistance,
  and progress replace stagnation.
  I agree with your Word,
  in Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.
