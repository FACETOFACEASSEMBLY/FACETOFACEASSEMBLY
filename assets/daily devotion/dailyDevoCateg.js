<strong>I CHOOSE LIFE OVER DEATH</strong><br><br>

<strong>John 10:10</strong><br>
“The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.”<br><br>

Every day of our lives, we are making choices. Some choices bring life, and some bring death. God has already shown us the right path, but He will never force us; He gives us the power to choose. Jesus made it clear that there are only two options: the destruction offered by the enemy, or the abundant life found in Him.<br><br>

When you choose Jesus, you are choosing life. When you reject Him, you open the door to destruction. In <strong>Joshua 24:15</strong>, Joshua spoke boldly, declaring that regardless of what the crowd did, he and his house would serve the Lord. Choosing God is choosing peace, direction, and eternal hope.<br><br>

Death is not only physical; it manifests as sin, fear, confusion, depression, and disobedience. Conversely, life is found in righteousness, joy, and truth. Today, God is calling you to make a clear decision.<br><br>

No matter what is happening around you, declare it with your mouth and believe it in your heart: I choose life over death, light over darkness, peace over confusion, and obedience over rebellion in Jesus’ name.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, thank you for giving me life abundantly. I choose to walk in Your life and light today and always in Jesus’ name. Amen.

<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

<strong>MONDAY 2ND FEBRUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>LET THERE BE LIGHT</strong><br><br>

<strong>Genesis 1:3</strong><br>
“And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.”<br><br>

When God commanded light to appear, it signaled the immediate end of darkness. Light does not argue with darkness; it simply displaces it. In the same way, light in your life signifies a divine change—the end of sorrow and the beginning of joy.<br><br>

The scriptures remind us that while weeping may endure for a night, joy comes in the morning. <strong>Psalm 30:5</strong>. Darkness is the realm of confusion, stagnation, and danger. Just as a driver must stop when their headlights fail, life without divine light leads to delay and backwardness.<br><br>

Light is the catalyst for movement. Once the light comes on, progress continues. When the light of God shines upon you, stagnation dies, and you are empowered to move forward and upward.<br><br>

Beloved, every darkness causing delay in your life must give way to the light of God. You cannot encounter His light and remain the same.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, let there be light all through the month of February. Darkness will not stop me in Jesus' name. Amen.

<strong>SATURDAY 31ST JANUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>THE BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Malachi 3:16</strong><br>
“Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.”<br><br>

The Bible talks about many books, but today we are looking at the Book of Remembrance. This is not an ordinary book. It is a heavenly record where God writes the deeds, tears, sacrifices, prayers, and faithfulness of his people.<br><br>

Until this book is opened, some matters will not be attended to. Men may forget you, but when the Book of Remembrance is opened, heaven cannot ignore you.<br><br>

Mordecai saved the king’s life, yet for years nobody rewarded him. But one night, God disturbed the king’s sleep. The book was opened, and suddenly Mordecai was remembered. One night changed his story forever. <strong>Esther 6:1–2</strong><br><br>

The children of Israel cried in Egypt for many years. It looked as if God had forgotten them, but the Bible says,<br>
“And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.” <strong>Exodus 2:24</strong><br><br>

When God remembered them, deliverance followed. Chains broke. Bondage ended. Egypt released them.<br><br>

Beloved, when God remembers you,<br>
delays turn into acceleration,<br>
tears turn into testimonies,<br>
long waiting turns into sudden lifting.<br><br>

One major thing that triggers the opening of the Book of Remembrance is the fear of God. May the Lord help us in Jesus’ name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, let the Book of Remembrance be opened for me. Remember my labor, my tears, my prayers, and my sacrifices in Jesus’ name. Amen.
