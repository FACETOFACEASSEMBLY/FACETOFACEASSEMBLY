  <strong>POWER TO TAKE IT BACK</strong><br><br>

  “No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.”<br>
  <em>John 10:18</em><br><br>

  This verse reveals something extraordinary about Jesus. When He died, it appeared as though His life was taken by soldiers, rulers, and enemies. But Jesus made it clear that no man had the strength to take His life. He laid it down willingly. And beyond that, He had the divine power to take it back again — the power of resurrection.<br><br>

  That same resurrection power is at work in your life today. The enemy often tries to steal from us — our peace, our health, our joy, our relationships, our opportunities. Sometimes the losses feel final, like they can never be restored. But the testimony of Jesus says otherwise. Because Jesus could take back His life, you too can take back everything the enemy has stolen, through the authority of His name.<br><br>

  Think about David at Ziklag. The enemy burned down his camp and carried away his family and all his possessions. David and his men wept until they had no strength left. It looked like the end. But David sought the Lord, and God told him to pursue — and that he would recover all. David obeyed, fought, and took back everything that had been stolen.<br>
  <em>1 Samuel 30:1–8</em><br><br>

  This shows us that with God, loss is never the end of the story. You are not helpless. You are not defeated. Through Christ, you carry divine authority. You don’t have to accept the enemy’s theft. You can stand, pray, declare, and take back your joy, your health, your destiny, your opportunities, and your blessings. Restoration is your portion. Recovery is your right in Christ Jesus.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, by the power of Jesus at work in me, I take back everything the enemy has stolen from my life. I recover my peace, my health, my joy, and my blessings. I declare full restoration now, in Jesus’ name. Amen.

    prayer: `<p><strong>NO MORE AFFLICTION</strong><br><br>

<strong>“What do ye imagine against the Lord? He will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.” — Nahum 1:9</strong><br><br>

This scripture is a simple but powerful promise from God. It means God does not put your problems on pause — He ends them. He shuts them down so completely that they do not rise again.<br><br>

We see a clear example in the story of the widow at Nain (Luke 7:11-14).<br><br>

First, this woman lost her husband. That was her first major heartbreak. She knew what it meant to be alone and grieving.<br><br>

Then, something even worse happened — her only son died. This was her second great affliction. In those days, losing her only son meant losing her last family support and all hope for the future. One tragedy after another.<br><br>

But then, Jesus came.<br><br>

He saw her tears, and His compassion moved Him. He approached the coffin and declared:<br>
<strong>“Young man, arise!”</strong><br>
And immediately, her son rose from the dead!<br><br>

This was not just a miracle — it was the end of her repeated afflictions. The sorrow that came the second time was destroyed forever.<br><br>

This story teaches us something powerful: God sees when we suffer back-to-back battles. He does not want us to live in cycles of pain. Jesus steps in to break the pattern, and He will step in for you today, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, affliction will not rise up the second time in my life, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

    prayer: `<p><p><strong>BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY</strong><br><br>

Jesus said, <strong>“I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.” — John 15:5</strong><br><br>

A part of this scripture tells us clearly that if we abide in Him and He abides in us, we will bear fruit.  
So if your life is not fruitful, do not accept it as normal.<br><br>

<strong>“And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.” — Genesis 1:28</strong><br><br>

Jesus once cursed a particular fig tree, declaring that no man would ever eat from it again. Why? Because when He came seeking fruit, He found only leaves and no fruit.<br><br>

<strong>Mark 11:14</strong> — “No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever.”<br>
<strong>Mark 11:20</strong> — “Now in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.”<br><br>

Curses manifest in the morning.  
Blessings also manifest in the morning.<br><br>

This morning, as soon as you wake up, pour water and the blood of Jesus on your feet and declare:<br>
<strong>“I MUST BEAR FRUIT!”</strong><br><br>

Say it out loud:<br>
<strong>“And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw me fruitful.<br>
They saw me joyful.<br>
They saw me fulfilled.<br>
They saw me carrying my baby.<br>
They saw me in my husband’s house.<br>
They saw me prosperous.<br>
In Jesus’ Name, Amen.”</strong><br><br>

I pray for you today:  
<strong>Your life will not lack fruit, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</strong><br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, I am a branch of the Lord. My life must be fruitful, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

</p>
