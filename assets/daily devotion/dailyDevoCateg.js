  <strong>SOMETIMES “NO” IS THE ANSWER</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Matthew 26:39</strong><br>
  “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
  nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”<br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 55:8</strong><br>
  “For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
  neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.”<br><br>

  We often pray expecting a yes.
  We plan around a yes.
  But God, who is perfectly wise and just,
  sometimes answers with no.<br><br>

  God’s no is not rejection;
  it is redirection.
  It is not proof that He does not love you,
  but evidence that He loves you too much
  to give you what will harm you
  or interfere with His righteous purpose.<br><br>

  Even Jesus, in the garden of Gethsemane,
  asked the Father if there was another way.
  The answer was no —
  not because the Father lacked love,
  but because divine justice required
  a greater yes: the salvation of mankind.<br><br>

  When God says no,
  it does not mean He ignored your prayer.
  It means He sees what you cannot see.
  His no is often mercy in disguise,
  protecting you from traps,
  saving you from settling for less,
  and preparing you for something far greater
  than what you asked for.<br><br>

  Do not interpret God’s no as abandonment.
  His no is still an answer.
  It is His way of saying,
  “I am just.
  I am wise.
  I am working all things together
  for your good and My glory.”<br><br>

  Your breakthrough is not cancelled;
  it is being curated
  by divine justice.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I believe that all things are working for my good.
  Teach me to understand You better.
  I submit my will to Yours,
  in Jesus’ Name, Amen.

  <strong>WHEN YOUR WAY PLEASES GOD</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 16:7</strong><br>
  “When a man’s ways please the Lord,
  He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.”<br><br>

  This scripture reveals a powerful kingdom principle.
  When a man’s ways are pleasing to God,
  God Himself intervenes in his affairs.
  He takes those who rise as enemies
  and restrains their hands from warfare.
  This does not mean enemies will not exist,
  but it means they will choose peace
  instead of destruction and open conflict.<br><br>

  When God is pleased with your walk,
  He becomes your defender.
  Battles you should have fought
  are neutralized by divine authority.
  Opposition loses permission to advance against you.<br><br>

  <strong>1 Thessalonians 4:1</strong><br>
  “Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren,
  and exhort you by the Lord Jesus,
  that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk
  and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.”<br><br>

  Pleasing God is the pathway to increase.
  Scripture teaches that when God is pleased,
  a man abounds more and more.
  Growth, elevation, and preservation

    prayer: `<strong>NO ONE WILL TURN MY GLORY TO SHAME</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 4:2</strong><br>
  “O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?
  how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing?”<br><br>

  Glory is God’s investment in a man. Shame is the enemy’s agenda
  against that investment. Many people do not lack destiny;
  they lack the preservation of glory. David’s cry in Psalm 4:2
  is not weakness—it is spiritual awareness. He understood that
  glory can be attacked, questioned, delayed, or mocked,
  but it must never be surrendered.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 8:5</strong><br>
  God crowned man with glory and honour. This means glory is
  not accidental; it is divine placement.<br><br>

  David speaks as one conscious of his divine positioning.
  He says, “my glory,” acknowledging ownership,
  yet confronting those attempting to convert it into shame.
  This reveals a powerful spiritual principle:
  glory attracts contention. When God marks a man with glory,
  opposition rises to disgrace it.<br><br>

  Shame is not always the result of sin; sometimes it is warfare.
  The enemy’s objective is not just to stop you,
  but to make your glory look like failure.
  The turning of glory to shame often comes through
  delays that resemble denial,
  mockery from those who once applauded,
  pressure to compromise identity for acceptance,
  and situations designed to make you doubt God’s Word.<br><br>

  But David understood a higher truth:
  men may attempt, but they cannot succeed without permission.
  No man has the authority to rewrite what God authored.
  If God called it glory, no situation has the power to rename it shame.<br><br>

  <strong>Job 29:20</strong><br>
  “My glory was fresh in me…”<br><br>

  I stand with God’s promise and declare
  that my glory shall remain fresh,
  preserved, and defended by God Himself.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, I declare that my glory shall not be turned
  to shame. Preserve what You have invested in me.
  Defend my destiny, silence mockery,
  and let my glory remain fresh by Your power.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.<br><br>
