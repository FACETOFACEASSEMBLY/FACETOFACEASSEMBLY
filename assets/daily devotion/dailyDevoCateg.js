    prayer: `<p>MOVE, YOUR NEXT LEVEL AWAITS YOU

“Let us go over to the other side.” — Mark 4:35

A man’s life is designed to move forward — from faith to faith, from grace to grace, and from glory to glory. Nothing about God is stagnant, and nothing about your destiny should be either.

When Jesus said, “Let us go over to the other side,” it was an invitation to progress. The other side represents your next level and assignment. It may not look easy at first, but if you move, you will see God’s glory at the end (Deuteronomy 1:6; Exodus 14:15).

Many fear the next step because of the storms ahead, yet storms are signs that the other side is worth it. When Jesus and His disciples faced a great storm, He arose and said, “Peace, be still,” and there was a great calm. Challenges only yield to those who confront them.

If you refuse to face your Goliath, you remain where you are. But when you press through, heaven crowns your courage. “Run that you may obtain,” says 1 Corinthians 9:24. The crown belongs to movers, not settlers.

Beloved, your next level awaits you. Move forward in faith. Break barriers, and embrace the glory on the other side.

<br><br>
PRAYER: <br>
My Father, my God, give me victory over every obstacle and the boldness to move into my next level, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

    prayer: `<p>ALWAYS GIVE THANKS TO GOD  

“One major reason God created us is for us to praise Him always, no matter the circumstances.” — Isaiah 43:21-22  

“These people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.”  

When Jesus faced scarcity, He didn’t first pray for supply — He gave thanks. Instantly, divine provision multiplied the five loaves and two fishes until twelve baskets overflowed (John 6:10-14). Gratitude opened the door to abundance.  

If the Son of God could give thanks before the miracle, how much more should we? In Luke 17:15-17, only one out of ten lepers returned to give thanks — and he alone was made whole. Thanksgiving completes your miracle.  

Even at Lazarus’ tomb, Jesus gave thanks (John 11:41-44), and life returned to what was dead. Whatever looks finished — your job, health, or peace — can rise again through thanksgiving.  

Beloved, gratitude is not optional; it is the key that unlocks God’s presence and power. Give thanks always, and you will see His mighty hand at work in your life.  

<br><br>
PRAYER: <br>
My Father, my God, give me the grace to thank You always, especially in situations that compel complaints. In Jesus’ Name. Amen.

    prayer: `<p>ESCAPE FROM DEATH BELONGS TO GOD  

“Our God is a God of salvation, and escape from death belongs to the Lord GOD.” — Psalm 68:20  

Every breath you take is proof that God alone has authority over life and death. No one escapes death by their own strength—it is the Lord who grants deliverance when destruction draws near.  

When Israel stood before the Red Sea, God made a way. When Daniel was cast into the lions’ den, God shut their mouths. When Peter awaited execution, God sent an angel to free him. Each escape was divine mercy, not luck.  

So, do not fear what men can do. The keys of life and death are in God’s hands. Walk in obedience and dwell in His presence, for your preservation is in Him. Every narrow escape is His reminder: “Your life is in My hands.”  

<br>
<br>
PRAYER: <br>
My Father, my God, I thank You because You are the God of my salvation. Thank You for every time You have delivered me from death and danger. I trust You completely to keep me safe and preserve my life according to Your will. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>`
