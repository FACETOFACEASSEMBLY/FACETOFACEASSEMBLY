<p><strong>CROWN MY YEAR WITH THY GOODNESS</strong><br><br>

“Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.” — <strong>Psalm 65:11</strong><br><br>

There is something glorious about how God finishes what He begins. The Psalmist declares that the Lord crowns the year with His goodness. The word “crownest” means to encircle, complete, and beautify — like a King placing a shining crown upon the head of the year.<br><br>

No matter how the months have passed — whether with joy or sorrow, victories or challenges — God’s goodness has the final say. He does not end your year in dryness but in fatness: prosperity, fruitfulness, and divine satisfaction. His paths are never barren; they “drop fatness,” meaning abundance follows Him everywhere.<br><br>

You may look around and see little, but heaven sees fullness. You may think time has run out, but God can do in one week what men could not do in years. He crowns your year, perfects it, beautifies it, and seals it with favor.<br><br>

Lift your eyes and believe! The same God who began the year with mercy will end it with miracles. Even in the final days, He brings divine surprises, opens new doors, restores lost opportunities, and overflows your life with blessings that testify of His goodness.<br><br>

When God crowns your year, no sorrow shall conclude your story. Every hidden seed of faith you planted shall spring forth in this season. His goodness will rewrite the ending of your year with joy, peace, and answered prayers.<br><br>

<strong>I decree and declare:</strong><br>
This year shall end in glory for me.<br>
The Lord shall crown my year with His goodness, and my paths shall drop fatness.<br>
My days shall overflow with divine favor, peace, and abundance.<br>
The crown of goodness is upon my head, and my year shall end with praise.<br>
In Jesus’ mighty name, Amen!<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, crown my year with Your goodness. Let the remaining days of this year drop favor and fatness. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>

    prayer: `<p><strong>LIVING TO FULFIL SCRIPTURE</strong><br><br>

Everything about Jesus was written long before He came to earth.
Every detail of His life — from His birth in Bethlehem to His resurrection — was a fulfilment of prophecy.<br><br>

He was not searching for purpose; He was walking in what was written.
The prophets spoke, and He lived to manifest their words.<br><br>

Again and again, Jesus declared, “That the Scripture might be fulfilled,” showing that His steps were aligned with Heaven’s script.<br><br>

When Judas betrayed Him — it fulfilled Scripture.
When the soldiers cast lots for His robe — it fulfilled Scripture.
When He said, “I thirst” — it fulfilled Scripture.
When He bowed His head and gave up the ghost — it fulfilled all that was spoken concerning Him.<br><br>

Jesus lived with one objective: to make sure the Word written about Him came to pass.<br><br>

Child of God, you too are a written prophecy.
You are not accidental.
You are not random.
You are a divine script waiting to manifest.<br><br>

<strong>Psalm 40:7</strong> says,
“Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me.”<br><br>

There is a heavenly record that carries what God has written concerning your life — your destiny, your ministry, your impact, your success.
But these things only manifest when you walk in alignment with God’s will.<br><br>

You are not here to compete with men; you are here to complete prophecy.
You are not here to create your own plan; you are here to walk out God’s eternal plan.<br><br>

When you live in disobedience, you pause what is written about you.
When you walk in obedience, you activate it.<br><br>

Every act of faith moves prophecy closer.
Every act of carelessness pushes it further away.<br><br>

<strong>Romans 8:29–30</strong> reveals that those God foreknew, He predestined, called, justified, and glorified.
Your life is written — but your obedience determines how much of that script becomes visible on earth.<br><br>

Jesus fulfilled prophecy because He stayed aligned with the Father.
Your fulfilment also comes through alignment, not ambition.<br><br>

There is something written about your life that must not die unfulfilled.
You are the vessel chosen to prove that God’s Word never fails.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, help me to walk in Your will and fulfil every prophecy written concerning my life.
In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>`

    prayer: `<p><strong>WHEN MERCY SEEMS FAR AWAY</strong><br><br>

“Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.” — <strong>Psalms 109:12</strong><br><br>

Mercy is the blanket that softens the blows of life. But when mercy departs, help becomes scarce, doors begin to close, and favor suddenly disappears. Even those who try to help find themselves dragged into unnecessary battles. This is the painful reality when sin, hypocrisy, evil, or foolishness pushes the mercy of God away.<br><br>

When a person walks in deceit, rebellion, or double-mindedness, the covering of mercy begins to lift. <strong>Isaiah 9:17</strong> reveals that when people embrace evil and foolishness, the Lord takes no pleasure in showing compassion — not because He hates them, but because His holiness cannot dwell with sin.<br><br>

If your life has become unusually hard…  
If favor seems to have dried up…  
If helpers suddenly vanish…  
It may be a sign that mercy has been driven far.<br><br>

But hear this loud and clear: <strong>the Blood of Jesus speaks a better word.</strong><br><br>

Child of God, whatever has pushed mercy away — sin, hidden hypocrisy, foolish actions, ancestral curses — by the Blood of Jesus Christ, let it be broken right now!<br><br>

The Blood of Jesus restores the mercy of God upon your life!  
Where rejection existed, receive divine favor.  
Where doors were closed, let mercy reopen them.  
Where helpers disappeared, let God raise new ones for you.<br><br>

Every curse that drove mercy away is destroyed by the Blood of Jesus!  
From today, let mercy locate you.  
Let mercy speak louder than judgment.  
Let God’s compassion rebuild everything sin attempted to destroy.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, I come before You in humility. If there is anything I have done — in word, thought, or action — that has pushed Your mercy away, I repent today.  
Show me mercy, in Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>`
