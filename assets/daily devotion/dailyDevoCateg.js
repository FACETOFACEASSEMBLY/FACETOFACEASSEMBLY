  <strong>BUILD YOUR CHILDREN</strong><br><br>

  Until your children succeed,
  you have not succeeded.<br><br>

  Before you build houses for your children,
  build your children.<br>
  <strong>Isaiah 54:13</strong><br><br>

  Invest in your children.
  Inculcate norms,
  values,
  morals,
  standards,
  discipline,
  knowledge,
  wisdom,
  truth,
  understanding,
  and prayers into their lives.<br>
  <strong>Proverbs 23:23</strong><br><br>

  If you fail to build your children
  before building houses for them,
  they may sell those houses
  you laboured to build,
  even with your grave still in it.<br><br>

  Food for thought.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 22:6</strong><br>
  “Train up a child in the way he should go:
  and when he is old,
  he will not depart from it.”<br><br>

  Catch them young.
  Catch them young.
  Catch them young.<br><br>

  When children are raised from the cradle
  with godly values,
  it shapes their system,
  their character,
  and their destiny.
  These principles follow them through life,
  sharpening their decisions
  and forming their success story.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 144:12</strong><br><br>

  What is planted in them today
  becomes what stands for them tomorrow.
  And in turn,
  they will pass these same values
  to their own children,
  and the lineage continues beautifully.<br><br>

  <strong>Joel 1:3</strong><br><br>

  Before you build houses for your children,
  build your children.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I decree that my children
  are for signs and wonders.
  Let them walk in truth,
  wisdom,
  and divine purpose.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.<br>

  <strong>GLORIOUS THINGS SHALL BE SPOKEN OF ME</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 87:3</strong><br>
  “Glorious things are spoken of thee,
  O city of God.”<br><br>

  Everyone desires a good name.
  Everyone longs to be remembered for good,
  to leave behind a mark
  that shines with honour and praise.<br><br>

  This scripture reveals
  a powerful truth:
  the Lord Himself
  speaks glorious things
  over His people.
  He calls us His city,
  His dwelling place,
  and He fills our story
  with beauty,
  purpose,
  and divine praise.<br><br>

  From the beginning,
  God intended glorious things for us.
  We are fearfully
  and wonderfully made,
  called out of darkness
  into His marvellous light,
  and destined
  to reflect His glory
  in the earth.<br><br>

  However,
  this glorious testimony
  can be dimmed
  by sin,
  doubt,
  worldly living,
  and forgetting
  who God says we are.<br><br>

  <strong>If you desire glorious things to be spoken of you, you must:</strong><br><br>

  Live continually
  in God’s presence.<br><br>

  Walk daily
  in the Spirit.<br><br>

  Serve in love,
  for greatness
  in God’s kingdom
  is measured by service.<br><br>

  Declare God’s Word continually,
  allowing His truth
  to shape your identity
  and testimony.<br><br>

  No one accidentally
  lives a glorious life.
  But as you align yourself
  with God’s purpose,
  I declare today,
  glorious things
  shall be spoken of you
  in Jesus’ Name.
  Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  let my life
  reflect Your glory.
  Let my story
  bring You praise,
  and let my testimony
  honour Your name.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>HOW TO BE GREAT</strong><br><br>

  <strong>1 Chronicles 29:11–12</strong><br>
  “Thine, O LORD, is the greatness,
  and the power,
  and the glory,
  and the victory,
  and the majesty:
  for all that is in the heaven
  and in the earth is thine;
  thine is the kingdom, O LORD,
  and thou art exalted as head above all.<br>
  Both riches and honour come of thee,
  and thou reignest over all;
  and in thine hand is power and might;
  and in thine hand it is
  to make great,
  and to give strength unto all.”<br><br>

  Everyone desires greatness.
  Greatness makes a man
  a light to the world,
  a source of hope,
  and a vessel of impact.
  Yet true greatness
  is not self-generated;
  it is God-given.<br><br>

  These scriptures reveal
  a foundational truth:
  greatness belongs to God alone.
  Power, honour, victory,
  and elevation flow from Him.
  Therefore,
  anyone who seeks greatness
  must first acknowledge God
  as the only true source of it.<br><br>

  From the beginning,
  God created man great.
  We were made in His image
  and likeness,
  crowned with glory and honour,
  and given dominion.
  That is greatness by design.<br><br>

  However,
  greatness can be hindered
  or diminished
  by laziness,
  excessive sleep,
  lack of knowledge,
  and distractions.
  What God plants as potential
  must be nurtured
  with intentional living.<br><br>

  <strong>If you desire greatness, you must be willing to:</strong><br><br>

  Make the right decisions.<br><br>

  Follow great and godly examples.<br><br>

  Live a disciplined and consistent life.<br><br>

  Be patient,
  because greatness is a process,
  not an event.<br><br>

  Scripture confirms this journey:
  Genesis 1:26–28,
  Daniel 9:2,
  Job 8:7,
  John 14:12,
  Proverbs 4:18,
  Psalm 8:5.<br><br>

  No one wakes up suddenly great.
  But as you walk this path,
  step by step,
  God Himself
  will make you great,
  and give you strength
  to sustain it.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  Father, my God,
  I receive grace
  to walk the path of greatness.
  Make me great
  according to Your will,
  and strengthen me
  for the journey ahead.
  In Jesus’ name,
  Amen.
