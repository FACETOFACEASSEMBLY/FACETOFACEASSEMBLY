    prayer: `
<p><strong>BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY</strong><br><br>

Jesus said, <strong>“I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.” — John 15:5</strong><br><br>

A part of this scripture tells us clearly that if we abide in Him and He abides in us, we will bear fruit.  
So if your life is not fruitful, do not accept it as normal.<br><br>

<strong>“And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.” — Genesis 1:28</strong><br><br>

Jesus once cursed a particular fig tree, declaring that no man would ever eat from it again. Why? Because when He came seeking fruit, He found only leaves and no fruit.<br><br>

<strong>Mark 11:14</strong> — “No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever.”<br>
<strong>Mark 11:20</strong> — “Now in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.”<br><br>

Curses manifest in the morning.  
Blessings also manifest in the morning.<br><br>

This morning, as soon as you wake up, pour water and the blood of Jesus on your feet and declare:<br>
<strong>“I MUST BEAR FRUIT!”</strong><br><br>

Say it out loud:<br>
<strong>“And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw me fruitful.<br>
They saw me joyful.<br>
They saw me fulfilled.<br>
They saw me carrying my baby.<br>
They saw me in my husband’s house.<br>
They saw me prosperous.<br>
In Jesus’ Name, Amen.”</strong><br><br>

I pray for you today:  
<strong>Your life will not lack fruit, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</strong><br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, I am a branch of the Lord. My life must be fruitful, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

    prayer: `<p><strong>GOD’S OWN</strong><br><br>

There is a realm where identity is not defined by tribe, achievement, titles, or the approval of men.  
There is a place where destiny is not negotiated and value is not voted on.  
It is the realm of divine ownership — the mystery of being God’s own.<br><br>

When the Most High divided the nations, He chose something for Himself — not land, but people.  
<strong>“For the LORD’s portion is His people.”</strong>  
This means your existence is not accidental.  
You are God’s deliberate possession.  
You are not a random soul on earth; you are a divine inheritance in the hands of the Eternal.<br><br>

In <strong>Matthew 20:15</strong>, God reveals a powerful truth:  
He has the right to do what He desires with what belongs to Him.  
Men may question His mercy.  
They may envy His favour on your life.  
They may not understand why grace keeps reaching for you even when you fall.  
But God answers to no one.  
You are His own, and His dealings with you flow from ownership, love, and eternal investment.<br><br>

And Paul declares with authority:<br>
<strong>“The Lord knows those who are His.”</strong><br><br>

When others are saying there is a casting down, His own will say there is a lifting up.  
His own labour little and reap much.  
His own do not beg for bread. — <strong>Job 22:29</strong><br><br>

God marks His own.  
He guides His own.  
He defends His own.  
He corrects His own.  
He invests in His own.  
No darkness is permitted to claim what God has stamped as His eternal property.<br><br>

To be God’s own is to live with a seal hell cannot erase and a covering men cannot explain.  
Even when life shakes you, you remain rooted in a foundation that cannot be broken.<br><br>

This is your identity.  
This is your confidence.  
This is your destiny.  
You belong to Him — and He will take care of you.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, thank You for calling me Your own.  
Thank You for choosing me even before I knew You.  
Let Your seal over my life speak louder than every accusation, every fear, and every opposition.  
In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>`

    prayer: `<p><strong>WAIT FOR IT</strong><br><br>

Life is a journey of faith and patience.<br><br>

<strong>“That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” — Hebrews 6:12</strong><br><br>

There is a phase in every believer’s life called the waiting season — a moment where results have not yet appeared, prayers seem unanswered, and silence feels louder than confirmation.<br><br>

This is the place between <em>“IT SHALL COME TO PASS”</em> and <em>“IT HAS COME TO PASS.”</em><br><br>

In this sacred space, God builds your character, strengthens your faith, and prepares you for the manifestation of His promise.<br><br>

Abraham understood this mystery and <strong>“staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.” — Romans 4:20</strong><br><br>

Even when nothing seemed to be happening, he chose worship over worry.<br><br>

And God reminds us again:<br>
<strong>“For the vision is yet for an appointed time; but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.” — Habakkuk 2:3</strong><br><br>

Waiting is not a delay — it is divine preparation, alignment, and growth.<br><br>

Job understood this deeply when he declared,<br>
<strong>“All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.” — Job 14:14</strong><br><br>

While you wait, keep thanking God.  
He who began the good work will surely complete it.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, let my change come speedily in the name of Jesus. Amen.</p>`
