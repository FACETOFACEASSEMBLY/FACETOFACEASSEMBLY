<strong>WALKING IN WISDOM EACH DAY</strong><br><br>

<strong>Proverbs 4:7</strong><br>
“Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.”<br><br>

Each day brings decisions, some small, others life-shaping. From how I respond to people, to how I spend my time, money, or energy, I find myself constantly needing one thing: <strong>WISDOM</strong>.<br><br>

Not just information. Not just experience. But God-given wisdom, the kind that helps me speak when I should and be silent when I must, that helps me see beyond the moment and choose what brings peace, not regret.<br><br>

The Scripture says wisdom is the principal thing. That means it is not optional; it is essential. It is not something to seek after everything else fails; it is what must be sought first, before taking a step, speaking a word, or making a plan.<br><br>

Wisdom is choosing honesty when lying seems easier, and choosing kindness when anger feels justified. It is the quiet guide that protects a life from unnecessary pain.<br><br>

<strong>James 1:5</strong> gives hope:<br>
“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God… and it shall be given him.”<br><br>

I do not have to rely on my own limited understanding. I can ask, and God will supply wisdom freely, generously, and daily. When I trust Him instead of leaning

<strong>SCOURGE OF THE TONGUE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Job 5:21</strong><br>
“Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.”<br><br>

Scripture tells us that God will deliver us in times of trouble. One of these troubles is what the Bible calls “the scourge of the tongue.”<br><br>

The scourge of the tongue means suffering because of someone’s harmful words. These words can be bitter, full of curses, or evil wishes. But the Bible assures us that the plans and words of the enemy will not succeed.<br><br>

Just as Goliath’s threats against David came to nothing, God can silence every voice that speaks against your life, your family, your health, or your work. Jesus Himself showed His authority over every enemy when He confronted Saul on the road to Damascus. It is hard to kick against the pricks.<br><br>

Be encouraged, the Lord will silence every destructive word spoken against you. As Scripture declares, He will keep His saints and silence the mouths of the wicked.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I ask that every word spoken against me, my children, and all You have given me will fall to the ground, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>I AM UNSTOPPABLE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Jeremiah 1:19</strong><br>
“And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.”<br><br>

When you say, “I am unstoppable,” you are not speaking of your own power. You are declaring that you are like the wind, moved by the Spirit of God. As Gamaliel said in the Acts of the Apostles, if a purpose is of God, no one can stop it.<br><br>

Joseph was given a dream as a boy. His brothers, Potiphar’s wife, and even a prison cell all tried to stop that dream, but they could not. God made him unstoppable.<br><br>

Even our Lord Jesus faced resistance from Herod, the Pharisees, the cross, and the grave. Yet He was unstoppable. The resurrection proved that nothing could hold Him down.<br><br>

To be truly unstoppable, you must be rooted in the Lord.<br>
• You must rely on the power in His name.<br>
• You must trust Him for victory no matter the turbulence.<br>
• You must continually declare His Word.<br><br>

As Paul said, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” Your strength is a gift from Him.<br><br>

“If God be for us, who can be against us?”<br><br>

Connect your purpose to His will. Anchor your journey in His strength. When you do this, you are no longer just a person with a dream — you become a vessel of divine purpose that hell itself cannot overcome. Your path is ordained, your protection is assured, and your end is certain in Him.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, today I declare by Your power that I am unstoppable. Strengthen me with Your divine power, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
