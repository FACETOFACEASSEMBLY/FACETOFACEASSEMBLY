<strong>FRIDAY 6TH FEBRUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>IT IS TIME FOR GOD TO WORK</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 119:126</strong><br>
“It is time for thee, LORD, to work.”<br><br>

Whenever God moves with His mighty hand, He is working, and the evidence of His labor is always visible. One primary way God works is by declaring light. From the beginning, His word has displaced darkness, bringing liberty, removing confusion, and breaking the chains of fear and bondage.<br><br>

Another way God works is by stretching forth His right hand. We see this in the life of Peter, who began to sink while walking on water. In his moment of fear, he didn't offer a long prayer; he simply cried, “Lord, save me.” Immediately, Jesus stretched forth His hand and rescued him. <strong>Matthew 14:29–31</strong>.<br><br>

The scripture reminds us in <strong>Isaiah 9:21</strong> that His hand is stretched out still. God’s hand is available for you today. All you need to do is cry out for His help and invite Him to work in your life. When you call upon Him to save you, you will experience an instant turnaround.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, it is time for You to work. Let Your light shine and let Your right hand, which is full of power, save me from drowning in Jesus' Name. Amen.

<strong>THE VOICE OF ACCUSATION</strong><br><br>

<strong>Revelation 12:10</strong><br>
“For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.”<br><br>

The voice of accusation is one of the strongest weapons of the enemy. It is the voice that speaks against you, reminding you of your past sins, failures, and weaknesses to make you feel unworthy of God’s love. The Bible identifies Satan as the accuser who seeks to bring condemnation, guilt, and shame so that you will draw away from God.<br><br>

However, the voice of God is different. While Satan accuses to destroy, God convicts to restore. God’s voice brings correction wrapped in love, not condemnation. This reminds us that God does not relate to us based on accusation, but on the power of redemption.<br><br>

Through the blood of Jesus, every accusation has lost its power. When the enemy speaks, God answers with mercy. If you are in Christ, your past no longer has a voice because the blood of Jesus speaks better things over your life.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, by the blood of Jesus, I silence every voice accusing me in Jesus' Name. Amen.

<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

<strong>WEDNESDAY 4TH FEBRUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>I CHOOSE LIFE OVER DEATH</strong><br><br>

<strong>John 10:10</strong><br>
“The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.”<br><br>

Every day of our lives, we are making choices. Some choices bring life, and some bring death. God has already shown us the right path, but He will never force us; He gives us the power to choose. Jesus made it clear that there are only two options: the destruction offered by the enemy, or the abundant life found in Him.<br><br>

When you choose Jesus, you are choosing life. When you reject Him, you open the door to destruction. In <strong>Joshua 24:15</strong>, Joshua spoke boldly, declaring that regardless of what the crowd did, he and his house would serve the Lord. Choosing God is choosing peace, direction, and eternal hope.<br><br>

Death is not only physical; it manifests as sin, fear, confusion, depression, and disobedience. Conversely, life is found in righteousness, joy, and truth. Today, God is calling you to make a clear decision.<br><br>

No matter what is happening around you, declare it with your mouth and believe it in your heart: I choose life over death, light over darkness, peace over confusion, and obedience over rebellion in Jesus’ name.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, thank you for giving me life abundantly. I choose to walk in Your life and light today and always in Jesus’ name. Amen.
</p>
