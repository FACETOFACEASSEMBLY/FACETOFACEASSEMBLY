<strong>THE VOICE IN MY BLOODLINE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Ezekiel 18:20</strong><br>
“The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.”<br><br>

Every one of us comes from a family, and none of us appeared on earth without a bloodline. In every bloodline, there is a voice speaking—it can be good or evil, speaking blessings or trouble. The Bible shows that both wickedness and righteousness have a voice that can influence a lineage.<br><br>

In <strong>Matthew 22:25–27</strong>, Jesus spoke about a family where death and barrenness repeated themselves from the first brother even unto the seventh. This illustrates how negative patterns can travel through a bloodline when they are not confronted. As <strong>Lamentations 5:7</strong> says, "Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities."<br><br>

To stop these patterns, you must take spiritual action:<br>
1. Silence the voice of darkness (<strong>1 Samuel 2:9</strong>).<br>
2. Call on the name of the Lord for deliverance (<strong>Joel 2:32</strong>).<br>
3. Invoke the superior voice of the Blood of Jesus.<br><br>

I pray for you: may the Lord separate you from every evil voice speaking against your life. May the voice of righteousness speak louder than every voice of wickedness in your bloodline in Jesus’ name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, I silence every evil voice speaking in my bloodline in Jesus' Name. Amen.

<strong>TAKE IT BACK</strong><br><br>

<strong>John 10:18</strong><br>
“No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.”<br><br>

This verse shows us something amazing about Jesus. When He died, it looked like His life was taken by soldiers and enemies, but Jesus revealed that no one was strong enough to take it from Him. He chose to give His life, and even more, He had the power to take it back again. That is the power of resurrection.<br><br>

This same power is for you today. The devil often tries to steal our peace, health, joy, or blessings. Sometimes it feels like he has won, but the story of Jesus tells a different story. Because Jesus has the power to take His life back, we also have the power in His name to take back what the enemy has stolen.<br><br>

Think about David at Ziklag. The enemy had burned his home and taken his family and belongings. It looked like a total loss, but David did not give up. He asked God what to do, and God told him to pursue and recover all. David went and took back everything that was stolen. <strong>1 Samuel 30:1–8</strong><br><br>

This shows that with God, a loss is not the end. You are not powerless; Jesus has given you His authority. You don't have to accept what the enemy has stolen. You can pray, stand, and declare in faith that you are taking it back. Your joy, health, family, and destiny are being recovered now in Jesus’ name.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My GOD, by the power of Jesus, I take back everything the enemy has stolen from my life. I recover my peace, my health, my joy, and my blessings. I declare restoration now, in Jesus’ name. Amen.

<strong>GOD IS FAITHFUL</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 37:25</strong><br>
“I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.”<br><br>

The faithfulness of God is a lifelong testimony. As the Psalmist observed over many years, God does not abandon the righteous or forget those who trust in Him. His faithfulness is not seasonal; it does not change with time, age, or shifting circumstances. From youth to old age, His hand remains sure upon His people.<br><br>

God has made a permanent commitment to you, declaring in <strong>Hebrews 13:5</strong>, “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.” His presence is not a suggestion but a promise. While people may fail and situations may shift, God remains righteous in all His ways. He cannot deny Himself, and He cannot fail His people.<br><br>

One profound expression of His faithfulness is how He sustains generations, ensuring that the seed of the righteous does not beg for bread. God is a keeper of generations; what He starts, He sustains. Even when you do not fully understand His process, you can always trust His character.<br><br>

Do not judge God by a single moment; judge Him by His settled Word. Hold on to His mercy and rest in His faithfulness. He has never failed, and He will not start failing with you.<br><br>

<strong>THANKSGIVING</strong><br>
My Father My God, I thank You for Your faithfulness. I am forever grateful. Amen.
