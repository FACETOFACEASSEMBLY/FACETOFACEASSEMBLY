<p><strong>NO MORE AFFLICTION</strong><br><br>

<strong>“What do ye imagine against the Lord? He will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.” — Nahum 1:9</strong><br><br>

This scripture is a simple but powerful promise from God. It means God does not put your problems on pause — He ends them. He shuts them down so completely that they do not rise again.<br><br>

We see a clear example in the story of the widow at Nain (Luke 7:11-14).<br><br>

First, this woman lost her husband. That was her first major heartbreak. She knew what it meant to be alone and grieving.<br><br>

Then, something even worse happened — her only son died. This was her second great affliction. In those days, losing her only son meant losing her last family support and all hope for the future. One tragedy after another.<br><br>

But then, Jesus came.<br><br>

He saw her tears, and His compassion moved Him. He approached the coffin and declared:<br>
<strong>“Young man, arise!”</strong><br>
And immediately, her son rose from the dead!<br><br>

This was not just a miracle — it was the end of her repeated afflictions. The sorrow that came the second time was destroyed forever.<br><br>

This story teaches us something powerful: God sees when we suffer back-to-back battles. He does not want us to live in cycles of pain. Jesus steps in to break the pattern, and He will step in for you today, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, affliction will not rise up the second time in my life, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

    prayer: `<p><strong>BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY</strong><br><br>

Jesus said, <strong>“I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.” — John 15:5</strong><br><br>

A part of this scripture tells us clearly that if we abide in Him and He abides in us, we will bear fruit.  
So if your life is not fruitful, do not accept it as normal.<br><br>

<strong>“And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.” — Genesis 1:28</strong><br><br>

Jesus once cursed a particular fig tree, declaring that no man would ever eat from it again. Why? Because when He came seeking fruit, He found only leaves and no fruit.<br><br>

<strong>Mark 11:14</strong> — “No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever.”<br>
<strong>Mark 11:20</strong> — “Now in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.”<br><br>

Curses manifest in the morning.  
Blessings also manifest in the morning.<br><br>

This morning, as soon as you wake up, pour water and the blood of Jesus on your feet and declare:<br>
<strong>“I MUST BEAR FRUIT!”</strong><br><br>

Say it out loud:<br>
<strong>“And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw me fruitful.<br>
They saw me joyful.<br>
They saw me fulfilled.<br>
They saw me carrying my baby.<br>
They saw me in my husband’s house.<br>
They saw me prosperous.<br>
In Jesus’ Name, Amen.”</strong><br><br>

I pray for you today:  
<strong>Your life will not lack fruit, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</strong><br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, I am a branch of the Lord. My life must be fruitful, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

    prayer: `<p><strong>GOD’S OWN</strong><br><br>

There is a realm where identity is not defined by tribe, achievement, titles, or the approval of men.  
There is a place where destiny is not negotiated and value is not voted on.  
It is the realm of divine ownership — the mystery of being God’s own.<br><br>

When the Most High divided the nations, He chose something for Himself — not land, but people.  
<strong>“For the LORD’s portion is His people.”</strong>  
This means your existence is not accidental.  
You are God’s deliberate possession.  
You are not a random soul on earth; you are a divine inheritance in the hands of the Eternal.<br><br>

In <strong>Matthew 20:15</strong>, God reveals a powerful truth:  
He has the right to do what He desires with what belongs to Him.  
Men may question His mercy.  
They may envy His favour on your life.  
They may not understand why grace keeps reaching for you even when you fall.  
But God answers to no one.  
You are His own, and His dealings with you flow from ownership, love, and eternal investment.<br><br>

And Paul declares with authority:<br>
<strong>“The Lord knows those who are His.”</strong><br><br>

When others are saying there is a casting down, His own will say there is a lifting up.  
His own labour little and reap much.  
His own do not beg for bread. — <strong>Job 22:29</strong><br><br>

God marks His own.  
He guides His own.  
He defends His own.  
He corrects His own.  
He invests in His own.  
No darkness is permitted to claim what God has stamped as His eternal property.<br><br>

To be God’s own is to live with a seal hell cannot erase and a covering men cannot explain.  
Even when life shakes you, you remain rooted in a foundation that cannot be broken.<br><br>

This is your identity.  
This is your confidence.  
This is your destiny.  
You belong to Him — and He will take care of you.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, thank You for calling me Your own.  
Thank You for choosing me even before I knew You.  
Let Your seal over my life speak louder than every accusation, every fear, and every opposition.  
In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>`
