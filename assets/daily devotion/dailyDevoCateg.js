  <strong>YOU SHALL NOT WEEP</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Luke 7:13</strong><br>
  “And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her,
  and said unto her, Weep not.”<br><br>

  The Lord has a prophetic word for your spirit.
  Hear it clearly:
  in the last days of this year,
  you shall not weep.<br><br>

  This is not a wish.
  It is a declaration from the throne of heaven.
  It is the same word of power Jesus spoke
  to the widow of Nain,
  and it is spoken to you now
  by the Spirit of God.<br><br>

  That widow’s weeping was justified.
  Her loss was real,
  and her future looked hopeless.
  Yet, into her procession of despair,
  Jesus stepped in
  and issued a command
  that changed the atmosphere of death.<br><br>

  He did not ask her to stop crying.
  He commanded her to stop.
  Why?
  Because His “weep not”
  was not based on her situation,
  but on His authority
  and His immediate intention to act.<br><br>

  This is your portion.
  The Lord sees the source of your past tears.
  He has compassion on you.
  And He is now decreeing
  that your seasons of sorrow are cancelled.<br><br>

  His “weep not” is a prophetic freeze
  on every plan of the enemy
  to bring you into mourning.
  It is a divine injunction
  against loss,
  against hopelessness,
  and against despair.<br><br>

  You shall not weep
  because the Lord of Life
  is stepping into your procession.
  He is touching what others declared finished.
  He is commanding a turnaround
  where doors were shut.<br><br>

  Your tears are being replaced
  with testimony.
  The same voice that commands your tears to dry
  is also commanding dead hopes to rise.<br><br>

  Receive this word by faith.
  Walk into the coming year
  with assurance
  that the Lord’s compassion
  has already gone ahead of you.<br><br>

  The last days of this year
  are marked not by mourning,
  but by miracles;
  not by lamentation,
  but by restoration.<br><br>

  You shall not weep,
  for the God of all comfort
  has spoken it.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I declare that I shall not weep
  in the remaining days of 2025.
  Let every cause of sorrow be terminated.
  I receive joy, restoration, and testimony,
  in Jesus’ mighty name.
  Amen.

  <strong>SOMETIMES “NO” IS THE ANSWER</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Matthew 26:39</strong><br>
  “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
  nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”<br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 55:8</strong><br>
  “For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
  neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.”<br><br>

  We often pray expecting a yes.
  We plan around a yes.
  But God, who is perfectly wise and just,
  sometimes answers with no.<br><br>

  God’s no is not rejection;
  it is redirection.
  It is not proof that He does not love you,
  but evidence that He loves you too much
  to give you what will harm you
  or interfere with His righteous purpose.<br><br>

  Even Jesus, in the garden of Gethsemane,
  asked the Father if there was another way.
  The answer was no —
  not because the Father lacked love,
  but because divine justice required
  a greater yes: the salvation of mankind.<br><br>

  When God says no,
  it does not mean He ignored your prayer.
  It means He sees what you cannot see.
  His no is often mercy in disguise,
  protecting you from traps,
  saving you from settling for less,
  and preparing you for something far greater
  than what you asked for.<br><br>

  Do not interpret God’s no as abandonment.
  His no is still an answer.
  It is His way of saying,
  “I am just.
  I am wise.
  I am working all things together
  for your good and My glory.”<br><br>

  Your breakthrough is not cancelled;
  it is being curated
  by divine justice.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I believe that all things are working for my good.
  Teach me to understand You better.
  I submit my will to Yours,
  in Jesus’ Name, Amen.

  <strong>WHEN YOUR WAY PLEASES GOD</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 16:7</strong><br>
  “When a man’s ways please the Lord,
  He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.”<br><br>

  This scripture reveals a powerful kingdom principle.
  When a man’s ways are pleasing to God,
  God Himself intervenes in his affairs.
  He takes those who rise as enemies
  and restrains their hands from warfare.
  This does not mean enemies will not exist,
  but it means they will choose peace
  instead of destruction and open conflict.<br><br>

  When God is pleased with your walk,
  He becomes your defender.
  Battles you should have fought
  are neutralized by divine authority.
  Opposition loses permission to advance against you.<br><br>

  <strong>1 Thessalonians 4:1</strong><br>
  “Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren,
  and exhort you by the Lord Jesus,
  that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk
  and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.”<br><br>

  Pleasing God is the pathway to increase.
  Scripture teaches that when God is pleased,
  a man abounds more and more.
  Growth, elevation, and preservation
