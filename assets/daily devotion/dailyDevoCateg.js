<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

<strong>PERILOUS TIMES</strong><br><br>

<strong>2 Timothy 3:1</strong><br>
“This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.”<br><br>

The word "perilous" means dangerous, hard, stressful, and troubling. The Bible does not say perilous times <em>might</em> come; it says they <em>shall</em> come. Apostle Paul warned that in these times, men would be lovers of themselves, covetous, proud, unholy, and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Looking around today, we see these truths manifesting as wickedness increases and the fear of God diminishes.<br><br>

As Christians, we should not be surprised or panic. Jesus already told us that as iniquity abounds, the love of many would grow cold (<strong>Matthew 24:12</strong>). Perilous times are not a signal to run away from God, but a sign to hold tighter to His Word. We are instructed to continue in the things we have learned and been assured of (<strong>2 Timothy 3:14</strong>).<br><br>

In these difficult seasons, our responsibility is to stand on the Word, live in holiness, pray without ceasing, and refuse to follow the crowd or water down the truth. Our prayer should not just be for the removal of the times, but for the grace to remain standing.<br><br>

Perilous times are certain, but God’s grace is always greater. No matter how dark the world becomes, the grace of God is sufficient to keep you and your household sanctified and secure.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, give me grace to stand with Your Word. Sanctify me and my household daily in Jesus' Name. Amen.

<strong>EVIDENCE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Revelation 12:10</strong><br>
“For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.”<br><br>

Evidence is a testimony, material, or object used to prove a point. In <strong>Genesis 39</strong>, when Joseph fled from Potiphar’s wife to maintain his integrity, he left his garment behind. That garment became false evidence used to put an innocent man in prison. Even though Joseph was blameless, the evidence in her hand spoke against him.<br><br>

We see a different outcome in <strong>Luke 22:49–51</strong>. When Peter cut off the ear of the high priest's servant, that ear on the ground was evidence that could have sent Peter to prison. However, Jesus touched the man and healed him. By doing so, Jesus removed the evidence and saved Peter from the consequences of his actions.<br><br>

Beloved, the devil is an accuser who uses past mistakes, sins, and failures as evidence against us day and night. But we have a greater Advocate in Jesus Christ. When Jesus steps in with mercy, accusation loses its power. Just as He restored the servant's ear, He can destroy every record of failure or object of accusation that the enemy holds against you.<br><br>

Today, ask the Lord to wipe away every proof of sin and every record of failure speaking against your destiny. When Jesus heals and forgives, the negative evidence is destroyed forever.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, by the power in the blood of Jesus, I cancel every evidence against me and my household in Jesus' Name. Amen.

<strong>THE VOICE IN MY BLOODLINE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Ezekiel 18:20</strong><br>
“The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.”<br><br>

Every one of us comes from a family, and none of us appeared on earth without a bloodline. In every bloodline, there is a voice speaking—it can be good or evil, speaking blessings or trouble. The Bible shows that both wickedness and righteousness have a voice that can influence a lineage.<br><br>

In <strong>Matthew 22:25–27</strong>, Jesus spoke about a family where death and barrenness repeated themselves from the first brother even unto the seventh. This illustrates how negative patterns can travel through a bloodline when they are not confronted. As <strong>Lamentations 5:7</strong> says, "Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities."<br><br>

To stop these patterns, you must take spiritual action:<br>
1. Silence the voice of darkness (<strong>1 Samuel 2:9</strong>).<br>
2. Call on the name of the Lord for deliverance (<strong>Joel 2:32</strong>).<br>
3. Invoke the superior voice of the Blood of Jesus.<br><br>

I pray for you: may the Lord separate you from every evil voice speaking against your life. May the voice of righteousness speak louder than every voice of wickedness in your bloodline in Jesus’ name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, I silence every evil voice speaking in my bloodline in Jesus' Name. Amen.
