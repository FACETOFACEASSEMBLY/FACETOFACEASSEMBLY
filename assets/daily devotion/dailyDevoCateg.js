  <strong>POWER OF UNDERSTANDING</strong><br><br>

  Understanding is life. Understanding is power. Understanding is light. Scripture says,
  “Give me understanding, and I shall live” (Psalm 119:144).
  God has no business with those who lack understanding. It is understanding that
  produces the hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold manifestations. No one succeeds in
  any field or calling until they gain understanding in it.<br><br>

  Everyone who walked with God in Scripture was a person of understanding—whether Moses,
  Daniel, or Apostle Paul. Their understanding positioned them to manifest the plan of God.<br><br>

  In Acts 8:30–31, Philip met a man reading the prophet Isaiah and asked,
  “Understandest thou what thou readest?” The man replied,
  “How can I, except some man should guide me?” This shows that
  <strong>everyone needs a guide to bring understanding.</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Ways You Can Gain Understanding:</strong><br>
  1. Study to show yourself approved (2 Timothy 2:15).<br>
  2. Follow men who have successfully gone ahead of you (2 Corinthians 8:15).<br>
  3. Ask questions—“Stand in the ways and ask…” (Jeremiah 6:16).<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, let the spirit of understanding come afresh upon me. Amen.<br><br>

  GOD BLESS YOU!

  <strong>THE POWER OF PRAYER</strong><br><br>

  Prayer is a weapon every believer can use to overcome the enemy. Until you pray, God will not move on your behalf. When the enemy captures your prayer life, he has captured your destiny. This is why you must guard your prayer life with vigilance and spiritual sensitivity.<br><br>

  <strong>Acts 12:1–5</strong><br>
  “Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.”<br><br>

  Herod continued killing the apostles until the church awakened to prayer. The slaughter did not stop until prayer began. It is prayer that halts demonic operations, stops wickedness, and brings the works of the enemy to an end.<br><br>

  <strong>Mark 1:35</strong><br>
  “And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.”<br><br>

  Jesus Christ—our perfect example—spent more time in prayer than He did with people. He understood that wickedness increases daily on the earth, and only a man of prayer can subdue it. If you must stop the works of darkness, you must become prayerful. Without a consistent prayer life, the enemy will gain advantage over you.<br><br>

  <strong>Mark 1:37</strong><br>
  “And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.”<br><br>

  After Jesus prayed, men began to seek Him. If your business is not growing, if opportunities seem scarce, it may be that your prayer altar is weak. Prayer puts an excellent spirit upon your work, your business, and your life (Daniel 6:3). It draws favour, influence, and divine attention. Every end-time believer must be committed to prayer to prevail and prosper.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, My God, revive my prayer life in the Name of Jesus. Set my spirit on fire, restore my hunger for Your presence, and strengthen me to watch and pray always. Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>GOD BLESS YOU</strong>

  <strong>THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM</strong><br><br>

  Today, in our time of praise, God’s Spirit is showing us the promise of His wisdom. Our "Alleluia" comes from a heart that has found the main thing needed in life: God’s own wisdom. This wisdom makes you see clearly when others are lost. It sets you apart and strengthens and lengthens your life.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 4:7</strong><br>
  “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.”<br><br>

  Wisdom is the most important thing. It is not just being smart—it is thinking and seeing the way God sees. The Bible teaches that if you lack wisdom, simply ask God, and He will give it freely and generously (James 1:5). This wisdom made Daniel and his friends ten times better than all the wise men of Babylon (Daniel 1:20). It is the wisdom that builds your house and establishes your family (Proverbs 24:3). It brings long life, honor, and peace (Proverbs 3:16).<br><br>

  But you must go to the right source to receive it. Glory to God who owns all wisdom and gives it to His children. Jesus showed this wisdom daily—never confused, never without an answer. Scripture reveals: “But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom” (1 Corinthians 1:30 KJV). Jesus *is* the wisdom of God. To have Him is to have heaven’s solution for every situation—your home, your work, and your life.<br><br>

  He became like us so we could receive God’s wisdom. Your “Alleluia” today is not the cry of someone confused, but the shout of someone with access to the mind of Christ. You are not navigating life alone. You have a Father who gives wisdom freely and a Savior who *is* wisdom. Ask, and you will receive.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father My God, I ask You now for Your wisdom. Forgive every foolish way in me and give me the mind of Christ. Let Your wisdom make me ten times better in all I do. Let it build my home, guide my decisions, and lengthen my life. I break every chain of confusion and error. Turn my darkness into direction and my questions into clarity. I receive Your wisdom now, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>GOD BLESS YOU!</strong>
