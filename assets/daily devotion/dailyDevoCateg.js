<strong>YOUR JOY CAN BE FULL</strong><br><br>

<strong>John 15:11</strong><br>
“These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.”<br><br>

Jesus spoke His words to us for a clear and wonderful purpose, so that His own joy would take root in our hearts, and so that our joy would be made full. This is not a joy that comes from our things or our plans. It is a joy that comes from His life living in us.<br><br>

Jesus said these things so that His joy would remain. To remain means to stay, to last, to be unshaken. If your joy is His joy, then it cannot be taken from you by the world, for it is rooted in heaven.<br><br>

A joy that is full has no empty space for fear or defeat. It is not a half-full cup, easily spilled. It is filled to the top and overflowing. This fullness comes from one place — abiding in His words and in His love. When you hold tightly to His promises, you are holding tightly to your joy. Your circumstances are not the source; He is the source.<br><br>

Do not let the thief steal what Jesus has given you. The enemy wants you to believe your joy depends on your family, your money, your health, or your success. But Jesus says your joy depends on Him alone. If you connect your joy to anything else, it will be divided and can be broken. But a joy connected to Christ is sealed and sure.<br><br>

Today, choose to receive His Word not as a burden, but as the keeper of your joy. Every command and every promise is a guardian of your heart’s gladness. All through 2026, let this be your truth: nothing shall separate me from the joy of the Lord, for it is His joy in me — and His joy is full, permanent, and victorious.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, let the joy of Jesus remain in me and be my strength. All through this year, let my joy be full, untouched by the world, and rooted in Your eternal love. I declare my joy is complete in You, in Jesus’ Name, Amen.

  <strong>SANCTIFY ME WHOLLY</strong><br><br>

  <strong>1 Thessalonians 5:23</strong><br>
  “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”<br><br>

  To be sanctified is to be set apart for God’s special use.
  And God does not want just a part of you—He wants all of you.
  “Wholly” means entirely, completely:
  spirit, soul, and body.<br><br>

  Many people try to give God their spirit on one day,
  but keep their soul—their mind, will, and emotions—for their own plans.
  They offer prayers,
  yet withhold their habits, disciplines, and physical choices.
  This is not sanctification; it is bargaining.
  A divided life cannot carry the peace of God,
  and a divided heart cannot shine with His glory.<br><br>

  God is the God of peace, not confusion.
  His peace flows when every room of your life
  is surrendered to His authority.
  Your spirit, your thoughts, your decisions,
  and even your body must come under His lordship.
  There is no lasting peace
  when part of you is still held back,
  afraid of what full surrender might cost.
  Just as a lamp cannot be half-lit,
  you cannot be half-sanctified
  and still fulfill your divine purpose.<br><br>

  The prayer for sanctification
  is a prayer of total surrender.
  It says,
  “Lord, every part of me belongs to You.
  I am not my own.
  Preserve me, keep me,
  and make me blameless,
  not by my strength,
  but by Your grace working in my whole being.”
  This is how a believer is prepared,
  not fragmented,
  but complete and filled with God.<br><br>

  Stop offering God fragments.
  He asks for the whole offering.
  Let there be no hidden room in your heart
  where doubts, fears, or secret sins are stored.
  Open every door,
  and allow the God of peace
  to sanctify you wholly.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, My God,
  I come to You with open hands.
  I hold nothing back.
  Sanctify me wholly—
  my spirit, my soul, and my body.
  Set every part of me apart
  for Your use completely.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.

  <strong>DON’T BE DOUBLE MINDED</strong><br><br>

  <strong>James 1:8</strong><br>
  “A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.”<br><br>

  A heart that tries to go two ways at once goes nowhere with God.
  To be double minded is to be divided in your heart—wanting God’s promise
  but also fearing the world’s way,
  trying to trust God while still making a backup plan that excludes Him.<br><br>

  This inner conflict produces instability.
  God is not found in the middle of confusion;
  He is found when you choose His side completely.
  Partial trust produces partial results,
  but God responds to full surrender.<br><br>

  The prophet Elijah confronted a double-minded people on Mount Carmel.
  He said,
  “How long halt ye between two opinions?
  if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him”
  (<strong>1 Kings 18:21</strong>).
  They had no answer.
  They wanted to keep both options open.
  But the fire of God only fell
  after Elijah made a single-minded, bold stand for the Lord alone.<br><br>

  James also warns us that when we ask God for wisdom,
  we must “ask in faith, nothing wavering”
  (<strong>James 1:6</strong>).
  A wavering heart is like a wave of the sea,
  driven and tossed by the wind.
  You cannot receive from God
  when your heart is divided between faith and fear.<br><br>

  God is a sure foundation.
  He calls you to plant your feet firmly on Him alone.
  You cannot hold God’s hand while clutching the world.
  You cannot claim His promise
  while listening to the enemy’s lie.<br><br>

  Choose this day whom you will serve.
  Decide to trust His Word alone.
  A single eye and a whole heart
  receive the full light of His guidance and blessing.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, My God,
  I choose to serve You alone.
  I reject double-mindedness,
  and I plant my faith firmly on Your Word.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.
