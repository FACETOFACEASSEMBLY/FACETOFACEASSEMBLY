<strong>FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END, HE IS GOD</strong><br><br>

“I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.”<br>
<em>— Revelation 1:8</em><br><br>

Many began this year with joy, yet fear now whispers, “Will you see the end? Will you finish in pain?” To every weary soul, the Lord Himself declares: I am Alpha — your beginning, and Omega — your ending. Your year, your life, your assignment is held between His eternal hands. The God who started your journey is the same God who has already been where you are going. He does not just observe time — He owns it.<br><br>

Some start well but do not finish well. But for you who are in Christ, your ending is not written by fear; it is written by God. The Almighty who walked with you in January is already waiting for you in December. Therefore, do not fear how this year will end. Do not fear how any God-ordained task will end.<br><br>

“A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.”<br>
<em>— Deuteronomy 11:12</em><br><br>

Just as God watched over the promised land, His eyes are continually upon you and upon every good thing He has entrusted to you — from the first day of the year to the very last. You are the land He cares for.<br><br>

“I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.”<br>
<em>— 2 Timothy 4:7</em><br><br>

Apostle Paul finished with joy because he knew the Alpha and Omega was with him, watching over his course from start to finish. The Lord who helped him begin helped him end. So shall it be for you. If God started it with you, He will finish it with you. You will not end in tears; you will end in His faithfulness, under His watchful care from beginning to end.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I thank You because Your eyes are upon me from the beginning of the year even unto the end. I place every fear concerning this year’s ending into Your hands. I declare that what You have begun in me, You will bring to a good and perfect end. Help me finish with joy, holding fast to my faith in Jesus Christ. Amen.

<strong>NO EVIL SHALL BEFALL THEE</strong><br><br>

“There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.”<br>
<em>— Proverbs 12:21</em><br><br>

As we continue in this blessed month, the Lord speaks a sure word of covering over your life. In a world filled with fear and hidden dangers, God has declared a fixed, unshakable promise concerning the righteous. You are not exposed to the traps of the enemy. The Lord Himself has decreed that evil shall not be your portion.<br><br>

“There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.”<br>
<em>— Psalm 91:10–11</em><br><br>

No weapon of eternal harm, no condemning verdict, no destructive power of the wicked shall prevail against you. You dwell in the secret place of the Most High, and under His shadow you abide securely.<br><br>

You are marked as just — justified by faith in Jesus Christ. Therefore, the mischief of the wicked cannot rest upon you. Your portion is preserved, your inheritance protected, and your testimony is this: Jehovah Nissi, the Lord your Banner, covers you. Walk in the assurance that your life is hidden with Christ, and no evil devised in the pits of hell shall overtake you.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I thank You for Your covenant of protection. I declare that I am the just, clothed in the righteousness of Jesus Christ. My life is secured in Your mighty hands. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.

    prayer: `<p> <strong>WELCOME TO DECEMBER: THE LORD SHALL BE YOUR EVERLASTING LIGHT</strong><br><br>

Isaiah 60:19
"The sun shall be no more your light by day, neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto you: but the LORD shall be unto you an everlasting light, and your God your glory."

As we enter this sacred month, God's word delivers a promise that transcends the changing seasons. In Isaiah, the Lord declares a profound shift from natural, temporary illumination to divine, eternal radiance. You were not designed to depend on earthly sources of light.  The Lord himself appoints himself your Everlasting Light.

But how can we walk in this supernatural light in our daily lives? Psalm 27:1 provides the foundation for this promise: "The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?" This scripture confirms that the Everlasting Light is a present reality for every generation that puts its trust in Him. This promise was written for you this December, for this moment in your journey.

You may walk through personal nights of uncertainty, waiting, or grief. The year may be closing with shadows you did not anticipate. Yet these two scriptures dissolve all fear. Your Everlasting Light is also your salvation and your strength. Every step taken in faith, these are acts of walking in the Light that has no end. You are living proof that God's glory outshines every temporary darkness.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, as I enter this month, let me walk in the radiance of your everlasting light. Be my glory in every situation, and let my life reflect your unending dawn.
