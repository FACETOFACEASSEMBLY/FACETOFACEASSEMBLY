  <strong>THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 23:1 (End)</strong><br>
  “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.”<br><br>

  The most beautiful thing a sheep can know
  is the voice and the presence of its shepherd.
  For the believer,
  to say “The Lord is my Shepherd”
  is to make the most powerful confession
  of trust and belonging.<br><br>

  It is to declare:
  “My life is not in my own hands;
  I am under the care
  of an all-knowing,
  all-powerful Guide.”<br><br>

  A shepherd does not merely feed the sheep;
  he leads them.
  He knows where the green pastures are
  and where the quiet waters flow.
  He sees hidden dangers,
  predators,
  and poisonous paths
  long before the sheep ever do.<br><br>

  When the psalmist says,
  “I shall not want,”
  it does not simply mean provision of food.
  It means lacking nothing
  that is truly needed
  for purpose,
  protection,
  and well-being.<br><br>

  Jesus confirmed this truth
  when He sent out His disciples without supplies
  and later asked them,
  “Lacked ye anything?”
  Their answer was simple and powerful:
  “Nothing.”
  Why?
  Because the Shepherd was with them.<br><br>

  Your Shepherd provides,
  yes,
  but He also positions you.
  He leads you to the right places
  at the right times
  for your protection
  and for His divine purpose.<br><br>

  He corrects your path
  with His rod of discipline
  and pulls you back
  with His staff of mercy.
  In the presence of your enemies—
  be they lack,
  fear,
  sickness,
  or oppression—
  He does not panic
  or retreat.<br><br>

  Instead,
  He prepares a table before you,
  a bold declaration
  that His provision
  is greater than every threat.
  He anoints your head with oil,
  a mark of blessing,
  healing,
  and separation unto Him.<br><br>

  His goodness and mercy
  are not occasional visits.
  They are constant companions,
  following you
  all the days of your life.<br><br>

  Walking with the Shepherd,
  therefore,
  is a walk of surrendered trust.
  It is not the absence of valleys,
  but the assurance of guidance through them.
  Every step is overseen,
  every need is known,
  and your destination is secure—
  to dwell in the house of the Lord forever.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I thank You for choosing me
  and calling me Your own.
  Help me to know Your voice more clearly
  and to follow You more closely,
  in Jesus’ name.
  Amen.

  <strong>PRAY FOR YOUR LOVED ONES</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Philippians 2:27</strong><br>
  “For indeed he was sick nigh unto death:
  but God had mercy on him;
  and not on him only,
  but on me also,
  lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.”<br><br>

  The Lord is placing a burden of prayer upon your heart today.
  This is not just a word for your own comfort;
  it is a divine strategy.<br><br>

  The mercy that spared Paul a double grief
  is the same mercy we must now invoke
  for those we love.
  Hear this by the Spirit:
  your intercession can be the barrier
  that stands between your loved one
  and sorrow upon sorrow.<br><br>

  Think of someone in your life right now,
  a child, a parent, a spouse,
  or a dear friend,
  who is walking through a valley.
  Perhaps they are sick in body,
  weary in soul,
  or shaken in faith.<br><br>

  Like Epaphroditus,
  they are “nigh unto death”
  in some area of their life.
  Your natural response may be to worry,
  to grieve,
  or to fear what might come next.
  But the Lord is shifting your posture.<br><br>

  He is calling you beyond anxiety
  and into authority;
  beyond tears
  and into triumphant prayer.<br><br>

  God’s mercy to one person
  is often His mercy to another.
  When God healed Epaphroditus,
  He was also sparing Paul
  the crushing blow of compounded grief.<br><br>

  Your loved one’s breakthrough
  is your safeguard.
  Their healing
  is your protection
  from a second wave of sorrow.<br><br>

  Your prayer for them, therefore,
  is also a prayer for your own heart,
  your own peace,
  and your own future.<br><br>

  Today, do not just worry about those you love;
  war on their behalf.
  Pray fervently that God shows them
  continual mercy:
  mercy in their health,
  mercy in their decisions,
  mercy in their trials,
  so that their victory becomes a wall
  around your own soul,
  lest you have sorrow upon sorrow.<br><br>

  Pray with the understanding
  that you are not merely a bystander
  to their struggle;
  you are a guardian
  of God’s mercy over their life.
  Your prayers pull heaven’s intervention
  into their circumstance,
  and that intervention creates
  a holy boundary
  around your own
  emotional and spiritual well-being.<br><br>

  Do not grow weary.
  The mercy you seek for them
  is the very thing
  that will preserve you.
  As you stand in the gap,
  you are activating
  God’s covenant promise:
  one mercy cancels two sorrows.<br><br>

  Believe it.
  As God shows them mercy,
  He is also showing mercy to you,
  sparing you both
  from a grief too heavy to bear.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  show us mercy
  and swallow every sorrow upon sorrow
  assigned against me
  and my loved ones,
  in Jesus’ name.
  Amen.

</p>
