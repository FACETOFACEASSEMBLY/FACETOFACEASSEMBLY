  <strong>THE MORE YOU STUDY, THE BETTER YOU BECOME</strong><br><br>

  Think of your faith like a house. A house needs a strong foundation and solid walls to
  stand firm. God’s Word is that foundation. When you neglect study, your spiritual life
  becomes vulnerable. Jesus warned that ignorance of Scripture and the power of God
  leads people into error.<br>
  <em>“Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.”</em>
  — Matthew 22:29<br><br>

  Studying the Bible is not only for pastors or teachers. It is essential for your daily
  life, your decisions, your growth, and your peace. A shallow Word produces a shaky
  faith, but deep study builds spiritual stability.<br><br>

  The best people in Scripture were always learning:<br><br>

  • The disciples did not only follow Jesus; they sat with Him, asked questions,
  and allowed Him to teach them how to live.<br><br>

  • Cornelius was a devout and praying man, yet he still needed understanding through
  Peter’s teaching (Acts 10).<br><br>

  • The Ethiopian official was reading the Scriptures, but understanding came only
  when Philip explained the Word to him (Acts 8:30–31).<br><br>

  • Even Jesus, as a child, was found in the temple listening, asking questions,
  and learning (Luke 2:46).<br><br>

  Here is the beautiful truth: what you learn is not meant to end with you.
  Jesus commanded us to teach others what we have been taught
  (Matthew 28:19–20). As long as you remain teachable, you remain useful in God’s hands.<br><br>

  Seek those who know the Word and learn from them.
  Study the Scriptures personally.
  Listen to sound teaching.
  And when understanding comes, be ready to share it with humility and love.
  This is how believers grow strong together.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, ignite in me a genuine hunger for Your Word.
  Open my understanding, strengthen my foundation,
  and help me grow through Your truth.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>KEEP BELIEVING</strong><br><br>

  There is a divine principle in the Kingdom: what hell has assigned to be permanent,
  God ordains to be temporary.<br>
  <em>“While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen:
  for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.”</em>
  — 2 Corinthians 4:18<br><br>

  Joseph understood this principle. He was betrayed, enslaved, and imprisoned for crimes
  he did not commit. He carried a God-given dream inside a man-made dungeon.
  His circumstances shouted “life sentence,” but heaven had already written
  “Prime Minister.”<br><br>

  <em>“Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon:
  and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.”</em>
  — Genesis 41:14<br><br>

  The prison is not just a place.<br>
  It is an assignment of delay.<br>
  It is a plot to bury a promise.<br>
  It is a system designed to make a man forget his destiny.<br><br>

  But throughout Scripture, God consistently rises to reverse the plots of the enemy.
  In Joseph’s life, when the enemy used the pit, slavery, and prison to destroy a dream,
  God used that same prison as the pathway to the palace.
  The place meant to break him became the platform that launched him.<br><br>

  <em>“And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this,
  there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
  Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled:
  only in the throne will I be greater than thou.”</em>
  — Genesis 41:39–40<br><br>

  Your delay may appear long, but it has an expiry date on God’s calendar.
  And God’s promotion always includes the authority to govern what once held you captive.
  God never brings you out without setting you over.<br><br>

  You are not stuck — you are in processing.
  The “hastily” of God can compress years of waiting into a single day
  of supernatural reversal.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, every prison assigned against my destiny must release me now.
  Let Your purpose for my life be established.
  I step out of delay and into divine fulfillment.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>POWER OF UNDERSTANDING</strong><br><br>

  Understanding is life. Understanding is power. Understanding is light. Scripture says,
  “Give me understanding, and I shall live” (Psalm 119:144).
  God has no business with those who lack understanding. It is understanding that
  produces the hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold manifestations. No one succeeds in
  any field or calling until they gain understanding in it.<br><br>

  Everyone who walked with God in Scripture was a person of understanding—whether Moses,
  Daniel, or Apostle Paul. Their understanding positioned them to manifest the plan of God.<br><br>

  In Acts 8:30–31, Philip met a man reading the prophet Isaiah and asked,
  “Understandest thou what thou readest?” The man replied,
  “How can I, except some man should guide me?” This shows that
  <strong>everyone needs a guide to bring understanding.</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Ways You Can Gain Understanding:</strong><br>
  1. Study to show yourself approved (2 Timothy 2:15).<br>
  2. Follow men who have successfully gone ahead of you (2 Corinthians 8:15).<br>
  3. Ask questions—“Stand in the ways and ask…” (Jeremiah 6:16).<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, let the spirit of understanding come afresh upon me. Amen.<br><br>

  GOD BLESS YOU!
</p>
