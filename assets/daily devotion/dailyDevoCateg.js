    prayer: `<p>**CONFIDENCE**  

“**And this is the confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us.**” — 1 John 5:14

Confidence in God is the deep assurance that He is faithful, His promises are true, and He will never fail. Even in times of uncertainty, trials, or when we feel distant from Him, our trust in God must remain unshaken.

Many people hesitate to approach God because of fear, guilt, or doubt. Yet, the Bible encourages us to come boldly before His throne. Confidence in God means knowing that He welcomes us, hears us, and cares for us. When we ask according to His will, He answers in alignment with His perfect plan for our lives.

“**Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.**” — Hebrews 10:35

Sometimes, we pray and still worry about whether God will answer. But this scripture reassures us that He hears and responds — though not always in the way or time we expect. True confidence in God is trusting that His response is always the best for us.

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego demonstrated this unwavering confidence when they faced the fiery furnace. They declared that even if God did not deliver them, they would still trust Him. That is the essence of faith — trusting in His sovereignty, not just His miracles.

Confidence in God silences fear and strengthens faith. It turns worry into worship and doubt into assurance. Hold on to your confidence, for God never fails those who trust Him.

<br>
<br>
**PRAYER:** <br>
My Father, my God, I have confidence in You. Hear and answer me according to Your will. Strengthen my faith and let my trust in You never fade. In Jesus’ mighty name, Amen.</p>

    prayer: `<p>**I WILL OVERTURN, OVERTURN, OVERTURN**  

“I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.” — Ezekiel 21:27

When God says, “I will overturn,” it is a promise of divine intervention. It means He will dismantle every order, power, or person standing in the way of His purpose. God’s overturning is not random; it is a deliberate act to restore what belongs to His chosen ones.

Zephaniah 3:19 reveals the meaning behind this promise: “I will undo all that afflict thee.” The word “undo” carries the same power as “overturn.” God breaks the hold of the oppressor, silences the voice of affliction, and restores honour to those who have been shamed.

When God begins to overturn, it may look like chaos, but it is divine construction in motion. He removes wrong people from right positions and replaces them with those He has chosen. He overturns delay, disappointment, and demonic influence until His will is fully accomplished.

God’s overturning is His way of undoing affliction and restoring glory. When He begins to move, no force on earth or in hell can resist His hand. Wait for Him — He will not stop until He has placed you where you truly belong.

<br>
<br>
PRAYER: <br>
My Father, my God, overturn every affliction and opposition in my life. Replace shame with honour and cause me to rise where I have been cast down. Establish me in the place You have prepared for me, in Jesus’ mighty name, Amen.</p>`

    prayer: `THE PLANT GOD FAVOURS DOESN’T NEED WATER TO SURVIVE  

“The plant God favours does not need water.” — Proverb  

This means that when God decides to bless a person, that person will flourish even in hard conditions. When divine favour rests upon you, what others struggle to get will come to you with ease. — Psalm 1:3  

A plant needs water to grow, but when God favours it, even if the rain delays, the plant will still blossom. The favour of God is a supernatural advantage. It opens doors that effort cannot open and attracts help where connections fail.  

Joseph was a man that God favoured. He was sold into slavery, yet the Lord was with him, and he became a prosperous man in the house of his master. He was in a dry land, but his life was green. His favour spoke louder than his location.  

Mary, the mother of Jesus, was also a woman favoured by God. The angel said to her, “Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee.” She was not the richest or the most known woman, yet God chose her to carry the Messiah. That is what favour does — it picks ordinary people and gives them extraordinary assignments.  

When God favours you, your background cannot stop your rising. People may not understand how you keep growing, succeeding, and shining even when things look hard — it is because heaven is watering you from above.  

Divine favour breaks natural rules. Isaac sowed in a time of famine and reaped a hundredfold in the same year. That is what happens when God waters you Himself. It is not of him that wills or runs, but of God that shows mercy.  

<br>
<br>
PRAYER: <br>
My Father, my God, make me like a tree planted by the rivers of water. Let Your divine favour water my life and cause me to flourish in every season, in Jesus’ mighty name, Amen.</p>`
