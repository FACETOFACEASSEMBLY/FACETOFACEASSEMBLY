<strong>OH LORD, MAKE ME TO WALK ON HIGH PLACES THIS YEAR</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 18:33</strong><br>
“He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.”<br><br>

There are some people who seem to move through life on a different level. They are lifted from one place of authority to another, finding favour and responsibility wherever they go. They are not destroyed by pits or prisons, but are carried above them. This is what it means to walk on the high places of life.<br><br>

Think of Joseph. From his father’s house, he was given a coat of honour. When he arrived in Potiphar’s house, he was made head above everyone, even in a strange land. In the prison, he was placed in charge. He was not merely surviving the low places; he was being prepared to rule in higher places. His journey from the prison to the palace reveals God’s power to elevate a life at the appointed time.<br><br>

Walking on high places is not about pride. It is about divine promotion. It is God’s grace positioning you where your gifts can serve His purpose. It is having a higher perspective above your problems and authority over your challenges. It is living in the fulfillment of God’s plan for your life.<br><br>

In this year 2026, do not settle for the valley. Do not accept fear, limitation, or lack as your permanent address. The same God who set Joseph upon his high place desires to set your feet upon yours. It begins with trusting Him in the low place, serving faithfully, and believing in the promise of elevation.<br><br>

Ask Him today. Cry out with faith and expectation: “Oh Lord, make me to walk on the high places of life this year.” Believe that He will steady your steps, make your path clear, and lead you into the places of influence and purpose He has prepared for you.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I ask for divine elevation in this year 2026. As You did for Joseph, set my feet upon high places. Take me from where I am to where You have destined me to be. Let Your favour lift me into new levels of authority and service for Your glory. Make my path clear and my feet sure. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.

<strong>WALKING IN WISDOM EACH DAY</strong><br><br>

<strong>Proverbs 4:7</strong><br>
“Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.”<br><br>

Each day brings decisions, some small, others life-shaping. From how I respond to people, to how I spend my time, money, or energy, I find myself constantly needing one thing: <strong>WISDOM</strong>.<br><br>

Not just information. Not just experience. But God-given wisdom, the kind that helps me speak when I should and be silent when I must, that helps me see beyond the moment and choose what brings peace, not regret.<br><br>

The Scripture says wisdom is the principal thing. That means it is not optional; it is essential. It is not something to seek after everything else fails; it is what must be sought first, before taking a step, speaking a word, or making a plan.<br><br>

Wisdom is choosing honesty when lying seems easier, and choosing kindness when anger feels justified. It is the quiet guide that protects a life from unnecessary pain.<br><br>

<strong>James 1:5</strong> gives hope:<br>
“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God… and it shall be given him.”<br><br>

I do not have to rely on my own limited understanding. I can ask, and God will supply wisdom freely, generously, and daily. When I trust Him instead of leaning

<strong>SCOURGE OF THE TONGUE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Job 5:21</strong><br>
“Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.”<br><br>

Scripture tells us that God will deliver us in times of trouble. One of these troubles is what the Bible calls “the scourge of the tongue.”<br><br>

The scourge of the tongue means suffering because of someone’s harmful words. These words can be bitter, full of curses, or evil wishes. But the Bible assures us that the plans and words of the enemy will not succeed.<br><br>

Just as Goliath’s threats against David came to nothing, God can silence every voice that speaks against your life, your family, your health, or your work. Jesus Himself showed His authority over every enemy when He confronted Saul on the road to Damascus. It is hard to kick against the pricks.<br><br>

Be encouraged, the Lord will silence every destructive word spoken against you. As Scripture declares, He will keep His saints and silence the mouths of the wicked.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I ask that every word spoken against me, my children, and all You have given me will fall to the ground, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
