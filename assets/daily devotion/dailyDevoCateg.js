<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

<strong>SUNDAY 22ND FEBRUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>LEARN TO GIVE THANKS</strong><br><br>

<strong>Isaiah 43:21</strong><br>
“This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.”<br><br>

One major reason God created us is to praise Him always, regardless of our circumstances. We see a powerful example of this in <strong>John 6:11–23</strong>. When Jesus was faced with scarcity while feeding the five thousand, He did not focus on the lack; instead, He gave thanks. Immediately after He gave thanks, divine supply was released, turning a situation of insufficiency into an abundance that left twelve baskets of fragments remaining.<br><br>

God expects us to thank Him in everything and for everything. In <strong>Luke 17:15–17</strong>, after Jesus healed ten lepers, only one returned to give Him glory. Jesus asked, "Where are the nine?" This shows that God is always waiting and watching for our return with thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is a spiritual necessity if you want to see the hand of God at work, for He inhabits the praises of His people (<strong>Psalm 22:3</strong>).<br><br>

Furthermore, in <strong>John 11:41–44</strong>, Jesus gave thanks at the grave of Lazarus. That act of gratitude brought the dead back to life. This means that when you thank God for a "dying" business, marriage, or career, you are inviting resurrection power into that situation. Instead of complaining, lift your voice to Heaven right now and give God thanks.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYERS</strong><br>
My Father, My God, give me the grace to thank You always, especially in situations that compel me to complain. I choose to praise You today in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>KNOCKING ON THE RIGHT DOOR</strong><br><br>

<strong>Isaiah 45:2</strong><br>
“I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron.”<br><br>

Imagine a man visiting a friend but knocking on the wrong apartment door. He knocks for a long time, waits, and knocks again, but his friend is in a different room waiting for him. The problem isn't the building or the timing; the problem is the wrong door. When you knock on the wrong door, you waste your time, your season, and your finances. Many people are sincere, but they are struggling because they are knocking on doors God never opened for them.<br><br>

When God goes before you, He ensures you do not waste your life on the wrong opportunities. He leads you to the right place at the right time. We see this with the disciples who labored all night and caught nothing. They were experienced fishermen, yet they were unsuccessful until Jesus gave them divine direction: “Cast the net on the right side of the ship.” The sea, the boat, and the nets were the same, but the direction changed. Success is often not about working harder, but about working under divine instruction.<br><br>

This year, you must refuse to move without God. Do not start a project, enter a relationship, or make an investment without His leading. Some doors look attractive but are empty, while others look small but carry your destiny. God knows the right people, the right business, and the perfect timing for your lifting.<br><br>

Ask God to show you the right door today. One right door, opened by God, can change your life forever. Refuse to waste your strength and resources on what God has not sanctioned.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, lead me to the right door this year. I refuse to waste my time, season, and finances. Lead me by Your Spirit in Jesus’ name. Amen.

<strong>THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 80:1</strong><br>
“Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.”<br><br>

The revelation of God as Shepherd is one of the greatest mysteries of covenant security. He is the Shepherd of Israel—the One who leads, protects, preserves, and causes His flock to triumph. A walk with the Shepherd is a victorious walk; when we truly follow Him, we walk a path free from confusion, lack, and abandonment. It is a walk where nothing is missing and nothing is broken.<br><br>

Jesus demonstrated this system in <strong>Luke 22:35</strong> when He asked His disciples if they lacked anything when He sent them out without purse or scrip. Their answer was, “Nothing.” This is the Shepherd’s system: when He leads, provision follows. When He sends, supply answers. When He guides, preservation is guaranteed.<br><br>

<strong>Psalm 23:1</strong> declares, “The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.” Notice it does not say "I may not want." When the Lord is truly your Shepherd, fear loses its voice and lack loses its power. Goodness and mercy become your daily companions. May the good Lord shepherd you all the days of your life.<br><br>

Declare this boldly: The Lord is my Shepherd. I shall not want. I shall not lack. I shall not be stranded. I walk in divine guidance, divine provision, and divine preservation in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>
