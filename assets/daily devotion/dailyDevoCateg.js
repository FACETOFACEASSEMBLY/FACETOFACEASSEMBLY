  <strong>THAT THE SCRIPTURE MIGHT BE FULFILLED</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Matthew 13:35</strong><br>
  “That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.”<br><br>

  Day by day, Scripture is fulfilled exactly as written—whether through prophecy, proverb, or divine utterance. Nothing that happens is random; everything aligns with what God has spoken from the foundation of the world. What we call “events” are often the unfolding of ancient words declared long before time began.<br><br>

  This is why Jesus repeatedly declared, “that the Scripture might be fulfilled.” Every miracle, every action, every moment in His earthly walk reflected what had already been written (Luke 4:21; John 18:9). Understanding what is written empowers you to interpret life from God’s viewpoint rather than from fear or confusion.<br><br>

  Scripture shows that five kinds of words can be fulfilled:<br>
  — The words written in the Law<br>
  — The words written by the Prophets<br>
  — The words written in the Psalms<br>
  — The words spoken by Jesus<br>
  — The words spoken by you (Numbers 14:28; Luke 24:44)<br><br>

  Everything written must come to pass because God watches over His Word to perform it. The birth, purpose, suffering, and resurrection of Christ were all spoken, written, and fulfilled with divine precision (Matthew 12:17; Matthew 8:17).<br><br>

  When you believe God’s Word, you step into the performance of prophecy. Faith positions you to partake in the manifestation of what Heaven has declared. Just as Elizabeth said: “Blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord” (Luke 1:45).<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, My God, I believe Your Word. Let it be unto me according to all that You have spoken. Fulfill every scripture concerning my life. Amen.

  <strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL BY TEACHER OF GOD'S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

  <strong>FRIDAY, 5TH DECEMBER 2025</strong><br><br>

  <strong>THE POWER OF AGREEMENT</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Matthew 18:19</strong><br>
  “Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.”<br><br>

  When God looked upon the people at Babel, He saw a formidable force. Their unity of language and purpose created a power so potent that Heaven itself declared that nothing would be restrained from them. This is the divine principle of agreement. It is not merely about human coordination; it is a spiritual key that unlocks heavenly action.<br><br>

  At creation, the Godhead said, “Let us make man,” and in that sacred agreement, humanity was formed (Genesis 1:26).<br><br>

  In the face of death, a wife can stand in agreement with Heaven for her husband's life. In the face of lack, friends can agree for breakthrough. This power is not a mystery kept from you; it is a key placed in your hands. Jesus Christ Himself affirmed it: “Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them...” (Matthew 18:19). The condition is clear: a united heart and a common purpose can birth greatness.<br><br>

  This is a call to action. Identify that God-fearing person who shares your spirit, who truly desires your prosperity and God's glory in your life. Approach them. Share your heart’s petition. Pray together. Agree together. For when covenant people come into agreement on God’s Word, they create a spiritual atmosphere where miracles are birthed.<br><br>

  Do not bear that burden alone. Do not fight that battle in isolation. The God who is present where two or three are gathered is waiting to confirm His Word in your midst. As you step out in faith to seek agreement, you activate a divine law. Heaven records it, and angels are dispatched to work on your behalf in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father My God, I thank You for revealing the power of agreement. Today, I receive the wisdom and the divine connection to find a covenant partner in prayer. As we agree according to Your will, I declare that every mountain is removed, every chain is broken, and every promise is fulfilled in my life. Let Your hand move mightily in all that concerns me. I shall testify to Your goodness, in Jesus’ Name, Amen.

<strong>FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END, HE IS GOD</strong><br><br>

“I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.”<br>
<em>— Revelation 1:8</em><br><br>

Many began this year with joy, yet fear now whispers, “Will you see the end? Will you finish in pain?” To every weary soul, the Lord Himself declares: I am Alpha — your beginning, and Omega — your ending. Your year, your life, your assignment is held between His eternal hands. The God who started your journey is the same God who has already been where you are going. He does not just observe time — He owns it.<br><br>

Some start well but do not finish well. But for you who are in Christ, your ending is not written by fear; it is written by God. The Almighty who walked with you in January is already waiting for you in December. Therefore, do not fear how this year will end. Do not fear how any God-ordained task will end.<br><br>

“A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.”<br>
<em>— Deuteronomy 11:12</em><br><br>

Just as God watched over the promised land, His eyes are continually upon you and upon every good thing He has entrusted to you — from the first day of the year to the very last. You are the land He cares for.<br><br>

“I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.”<br>
<em>— 2 Timothy 4:7</em><br><br>

Apostle Paul finished with joy because he knew the Alpha and Omega was with him, watching over his course from start to finish. The Lord who helped him begin helped him end. So shall it be for you. If God started it with you, He will finish it with you. You will not end in tears; you will end in His faithfulness, under His watchful care from beginning to end.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, I thank You because Your eyes are upon me from the beginning of the year even unto the end. I place every fear concerning this year’s ending into Your hands. I declare that what You have begun in me, You will bring to a good and perfect end. Help me finish with joy, holding fast to my faith in Jesus Christ. Amen.
