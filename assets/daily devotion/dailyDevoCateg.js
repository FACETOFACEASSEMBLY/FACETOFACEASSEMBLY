  <strong>LEARN TO DO WELL IN 2026</strong><br><br>

  There is always
  a better version of you.
  If only you can learn
  to do well,
  you can become
  a better pastor,
  a better father,
  a better mother,
  a better businessman,
  or even
  a better student.
  This is not a gift;
  it is an act
  of discipline.<br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 1:17</strong><br>
  “Learn to do well;
  seek judgment,
  relieve the oppressed,
  judge the fatherless,
  plead for the widow.”<br><br>

  God spoke to Cain,
  revealing a powerful truth:
  if he had done well,
  his offering
  would have been accepted.<br><br>

  <strong>Genesis 4:7</strong><br>
  “If thou doest well,
  shalt thou not be accepted?
  And if thou doest not well,
  sin lieth at the door.
  And unto thee shall be his desire,
  and thou shalt rule over him.”<br><br>

  When a person
  consistently does well,
  glory follows.
  Reputation is shaped
  by obedience,
  diligence,
  and excellence.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 87:3</strong><br>
  “Glorious things are spoken of thee,
  O city of God.”<br><br>

  Apostle Paul
  requested Mark
  because he had grown
  into usefulness.
  Doing well
  makes you profitable
  in God’s kingdom.<br><br>

  <strong>2 Timothy 4:11</strong><br>
  “Take Mark,
  and bring him with thee:
  for he is profitable to me
  for the ministry.”<br><br>

  Joseph instructed his brothers
  to tell their father
  of his glory in Egypt
  because his life
  had produced visible results.
  Doing well
  cannot be hidden.<br><br>

  <strong>Genesis 45:13</strong><br>
  “And ye shall tell my father
  of all my glory in Egypt,
  and of all that ye have seen.”<br><br>

  You do well
  by embracing truth,
  walking in wisdom,
  accepting instruction,
  and growing in understanding.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 23:23</strong><br>
  “Buy the truth,
  and sell it not;
  also wisdom,
  and instruction,
  and understanding.”<br><br>

  Doing well
  is a deliberate choice.
  It is a lifestyle
  that attracts honor,
  favor,
  and divine acceptance.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  give me the grace
  to do well.
  Let my life
  bring You glory
  and produce excellence
  in all I do.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.

  <strong>A NEW THING, A FRESH PATH</strong><br><br>

  The page has turned.
  The old has passed away,
  and a new year has come.
  This moment is a gift
  from the hand of the Father,
  a fresh path,
  a morning filled with mercy.
  Do not step into it
  carrying the heavy bundles
  of last year’s fears.
  Step into it
  with a heart prepared
  for what God will do.<br><br>

  <strong>Isaiah 43:18–19</strong><br>
  “Remember ye not the former things,
  neither consider the things of old.
  Behold, I will do a new thing;
  now it shall spring forth;
  shall ye not know it?
  I will even make a way in the wilderness,
  and rivers in the desert.”<br><br>

  The path ahead is unknown to us.
  We cannot see around its bends.
  But we do not walk it alone,
  and we do not walk it blind.
  We walk with the One
  who is already there.
  He goes before you.
  He levels the mountains
  and bridges the valleys.
  Your assignment
  is not to see the entire journey,
  but to trust the Guide
  for the very next step.<br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 3:5–6</strong><br>
  “Trust in the LORD with all thine heart;
  and lean not unto thine own understanding.
  In all thy ways acknowledge Him,
  and He shall direct thy paths.”<br><br>

  On this first day of the year,
  let us set our hearts.
  Let us plant our feet
  on this new path
  with holy expectation.
  In your spirit,
  speak one hope for 2026:<br><br>

  · One area where you will trust Him more.<br>
  · One habit you will ask Him to help you build.<br>
  · One person you will intentionally show His love to.<br>
  · One promise from His Word you will stand upon.<br><br>

  This act of expectation
  is an act of faith.
  It declares,
  “My God, I believe You are good.
  I believe Your plans for me are good.
  I am ready to follow.
  Help me.”<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I stand at the beginning of this new year
  with thanksgiving and with faith.
  You have been faithful,
  and You will remain faithful.
  I choose to trust You
  with all that lies ahead.
  Guide my steps.
  Order my path.
  My eyes are fixed on You.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.<br><br>

  May the Lord bless you in this new year.
  May you walk daily
  in His fresh mercies,
  His clear direction,
  and His unfailing grace.
  Welcome to 2026.

  <strong>BE LED BY THE SPIRIT THIS YEAR</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Romans 8:1</strong><br>
  “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus,
  who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”<br><br>

  To walk in the Spirit
  is to live daily
  under the influence,
  direction,
  and power
  of the Holy Ghost.
  This life is not sustained
  by human strength
  or self-effort.
  It is only possible
  by the help
  of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>

  <strong>Romans 8:14</strong><br>
  “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,
  they are the sons of God.”<br><br>

  True sonship in Christ
  is revealed
  through a Spirit-led life.
  The evidence of maturity
  is not noise or activity,
  but obedience
  to divine leading.<br><br>

  The first step
  to walking in the Spirit
  is alignment
  with the Word of God.
  You must live
  with the awareness
  of God’s power,
  holiness,
  love,
  grace,
  and the finished work
  of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>

  <strong>John 6:63</strong><br>
  “It is the Spirit that quickeneth;
  the flesh profiteth nothing:
  the words that I speak unto you,
  they are spirit,
  and they are life.”<br><br>

  Where the Spirit of God dwells,
  there is liberty,
  joy,
  light,
  fruitfulness,
  and laughter.<br><br>

  <strong>2 Corinthians 3:17</strong><br>
  “Now the Lord is that Spirit:
  and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
  there is liberty.”<br><br>

  Renew your mind.
  Refuse to think
  according to this world.
  Choose to think
  according to the Word of God.
  No one prospers
  or lives victoriously
  under the influence of the flesh.
  Only by the Spirit
  can a man overcome
  and walk
  in divine success.<br><br>

  Walking in the Spirit
  is both a choice
  and a mindset.
  The Spirit is available to all,
  but yielding
  is a personal responsibility.
  You must decide
  daily
  to follow His leading.<br><br>

  Apostle Paul declared
  that he kept his body
  under subjection,
  reminding us
  that discipline of the flesh
  allows the Spirit
  to prevail.<br><br>

  <strong>1 Corinthians 9:27</strong><br>
  “But I keep under my body,
  and bring it into subjection…”<br><br>

  As you live by God’s Word
  and continually yield
  to His Spirit,
  you will be transformed
  day by day
  into the likeness of Christ.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  help me to walk daily
  in the Spirit.
  Let my flesh be subdued
  and my heart be sensitive
  to Your leading.
  I choose Your will,
  Your way,
  and Your voice.
  In Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.
