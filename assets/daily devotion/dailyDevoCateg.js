<p><strong>GOD WORKS ACCORDING TO HIS NAME</strong><br><br>

“And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.” — <strong>Exodus 6:3</strong><br><br>

How God appears to you is how He answers you.  
Every name of God reveals a dimension of His power, and the revelation you carry determines the manifestation you experience.<br><br>

When He told Moses, “I AM THAT I AM,” He revealed Himself as the Self-Existent, All-Sufficient, Ever-Present God — the One who becomes whatever His people need Him to be (<strong>Exodus 3:14</strong>).<br><br>

When He manifests as the Consuming Fire, He burns away everything that stands against His purpose in your life (<strong>Hebrews 12:29</strong>).<br><br>

When He reveals Himself as the Faithful God, He reminds you that His promises never fail (<strong>Deuteronomy 7:9</strong>; <strong>1 Thessalonians 5:24</strong>).<br><br>

When He brings increase to your life, He is the God of Increase (<strong>1 Corinthians 3:6–7</strong>).<br><br>

When He opens your doors and the womb of your destiny, He is the God of Fruitfulness (<strong>Genesis 30:22–23</strong>).<br><br>

And when He forgives and cleanses your sins, He appears as the Merciful God (<strong>Daniel 9:9</strong>; <strong>1 John 1:9</strong>).<br><br>

The way God appears to you is the way He will answer you.  
May He appear to you today as the God Who Answers Prayer (<strong>Jeremiah 33:3</strong>; <strong>Psalm 65:2</strong>).<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, appear to me as the Merciful God, in Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>

    prayer: `<p><strong>LIVING TO FULFIL SCRIPTURE</strong><br><br>

Everything about Jesus was written long before He came to earth.
Every detail of His life — from His birth in Bethlehem to His resurrection — was a fulfilment of prophecy.<br><br>

He was not searching for purpose; He was walking in what was written.
The prophets spoke, and He lived to manifest their words.<br><br>

Again and again, Jesus declared, “That the Scripture might be fulfilled,” showing that His steps were aligned with Heaven’s script.<br><br>

When Judas betrayed Him — it fulfilled Scripture.
When the soldiers cast lots for His robe — it fulfilled Scripture.
When He said, “I thirst” — it fulfilled Scripture.
When He bowed His head and gave up the ghost — it fulfilled all that was spoken concerning Him.<br><br>

Jesus lived with one objective: to make sure the Word written about Him came to pass.<br><br>

Child of God, you too are a written prophecy.
You are not accidental.
You are not random.
You are a divine script waiting to manifest.<br><br>

<strong>Psalm 40:7</strong> says,
“Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me.”<br><br>

There is a heavenly record that carries what God has written concerning your life — your destiny, your ministry, your impact, your success.
But these things only manifest when you walk in alignment with God’s will.<br><br>

You are not here to compete with men; you are here to complete prophecy.
You are not here to create your own plan; you are here to walk out God’s eternal plan.<br><br>

When you live in disobedience, you pause what is written about you.
When you walk in obedience, you activate it.<br><br>

Every act of faith moves prophecy closer.
Every act of carelessness pushes it further away.<br><br>

<strong>Romans 8:29–30</strong> reveals that those God foreknew, He predestined, called, justified, and glorified.
Your life is written — but your obedience determines how much of that script becomes visible on earth.<br><br>

Jesus fulfilled prophecy because He stayed aligned with the Father.
Your fulfilment also comes through alignment, not ambition.<br><br>

There is something written about your life that must not die unfulfilled.
You are the vessel chosen to prove that God’s Word never fails.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, help me to walk in Your will and fulfil every prophecy written concerning my life.
In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>`
