<p><strong>GOD’S OWN</strong><br><br>

There is a realm where identity is not defined by tribe, achievement, titles, or the approval of men.  
There is a place where destiny is not negotiated and value is not voted on.  
It is the realm of divine ownership — the mystery of being God’s own.<br><br>

When the Most High divided the nations, He chose something for Himself — not land, but people.  
<strong>“For the LORD’s portion is His people.”</strong>  
This means your existence is not accidental.  
You are God’s deliberate possession.  
You are not a random soul on earth; you are a divine inheritance in the hands of the Eternal.<br><br>

In <strong>Matthew 20:15</strong>, God reveals a powerful truth:  
He has the right to do what He desires with what belongs to Him.  
Men may question His mercy.  
They may envy His favour on your life.  
They may not understand why grace keeps reaching for you even when you fall.  
But God answers to no one.  
You are His own, and His dealings with you flow from ownership, love, and eternal investment.<br><br>

And Paul declares with authority:<br>
<strong>“The Lord knows those who are His.”</strong><br><br>

When others are saying there is a casting down, His own will say there is a lifting up.  
His own labour little and reap much.  
His own do not beg for bread. — <strong>Job 22:29</strong><br><br>

God marks His own.  
He guides His own.  
He defends His own.  
He corrects His own.  
He invests in His own.  
No darkness is permitted to claim what God has stamped as His eternal property.<br><br>

To be God’s own is to live with a seal hell cannot erase and a covering men cannot explain.  
Even when life shakes you, you remain rooted in a foundation that cannot be broken.<br><br>

This is your identity.  
This is your confidence.  
This is your destiny.  
You belong to Him — and He will take care of you.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, thank You for calling me Your own.  
Thank You for choosing me even before I knew You.  
Let Your seal over my life speak louder than every accusation, every fear, and every opposition.  
In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>

    prayer: `<p><strong>IDENTITY — KNOWING WHO YOU ARE IN CHRIST JESUS</strong><br><br>

One of the greatest revelations a believer can ever receive is the revelation of identity.  
Until you know who you are in Christ, life will define you by your past, people will define you by your mistakes, and the enemy will define you by your weakness.  
But the moment you discover who you truly are in Jesus, everything changes — your confidence changes, your prayer life changes, your expectations change, and your destiny opens.  
Identity is not a suggestion; it is the foundation of your victory in Christ.<br><br>

Satan’s greatest weapon is to make you forget who you are.  
God’s greatest desire is to open your eyes to who you have always been in Him.<br><br>

The day you received Christ, your identity changed:<br>
You moved from sinner to redeemed.  
From rejected to accepted.  
From ordinary to royal.  
From powerless to authorized.<br><br>

<strong>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature:  
old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” — 2 Corinthians 5:17</strong><br><br>

This is why the enemy fights your mind — because if you ever fully know who you are, his hold breaks forever.<br><br>

Rise above the voice of doubt, fear, guilt, and shame.  
Walk boldly. Pray boldly. Live boldly.  
You are not defined by where you came from.  
You are defined by Who lives in you.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, open my spirit to truly understand who I am in Christ Jesus.  
Break every lie that has limited my identity.  
Let the revelation of my sonship, authority, and righteousness fill my heart.  
From today, I walk boldly in the identity You gave me.  
In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>`
