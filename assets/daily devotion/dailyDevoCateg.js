<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

<strong>SATURDAY 31ST JANUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>THE BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Malachi 3:16</strong><br>
“Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.”<br><br>

The Bible talks about many books, but today we are looking at the Book of Remembrance. This is not an ordinary book. It is a heavenly record where God writes the deeds, tears, sacrifices, prayers, and faithfulness of his people.<br><br>

Until this book is opened, some matters will not be attended to. Men may forget you, but when the Book of Remembrance is opened, heaven cannot ignore you.<br><br>

Mordecai saved the king’s life, yet for years nobody rewarded him. But one night, God disturbed the king’s sleep. The book was opened, and suddenly Mordecai was remembered. One night changed his story forever. <strong>Esther 6:1–2</strong><br><br>

The children of Israel cried in Egypt for many years. It looked as if God had forgotten them, but the Bible says,<br>
“And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.” <strong>Exodus 2:24</strong><br><br>

When God remembered them, deliverance followed. Chains broke. Bondage ended. Egypt released them.<br><br>

Beloved, when God remembers you,<br>
delays turn into acceleration,<br>
tears turn into testimonies,<br>
long waiting turns into sudden lifting.<br><br>

One major thing that triggers the opening of the Book of Remembrance is the fear of God. May the Lord help us in Jesus’ name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, let the Book of Remembrance be opened for me. Remember my labor, my tears, my prayers, and my sacrifices in Jesus’ name. Amen.

<strong>WHO IS A CHRISTIAN?</strong><br><br>

<strong>Acts 11:26</strong><br>
“And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.”<br><br>

Many people today claim to be Christians, but few truly understand what the word means. A few days ago, I asked a young man who a Christian is, and he said, “A Christian is a person that follows God and eschews evil.” While that answer sounds right, it is incomplete.<br><br>

The truth is this: a Christian is a person who follows Jesus Christ. A Christian is one who believes in the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>

Many people follow God. The Jews follow God. Muslims follow God. Many religions believe in God. But what separates a Christian from others is Jesus. They will never agree with you on Jesus, but Christianity stands or falls on Him.<br><br>

The Bible says in Acts 11:26 that the disciples were called Christians. They did not name themselves. People watched their lives, studied their conduct, and saw their character, and then called them Christians. Their character revealed Christ.<br><br>

This teaches us a deep truth: your character matters. You are not a Christian because you attend church. You are called a Christian when your life looks like Christ.<br><br>

In Galatians 5:1, the Scripture says, “Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free…” A Christian is already delivered from bondage through Christ. Sin, darkness, and the flesh no longer have dominion. But that freedom must show evidence.<br><br>

In Galatians 5:22–23, the Bible reveals the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance. These fruits are the proof of a Christian life.<br><br>

A Christian must not walk in darkness. A Christian must walk in the light of Christ.<br><br>

The Bible says, “Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith” (Hebrews 12:2). Jesus is not only the beginning of our faith, He is also the standard. When we look unto Him, our lives are shaped to reflect Him.<br><br>

Christianity is not just confession; it is transformation. Not just belief, but becoming like Christ.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, my God, help me to follow Jesus truly. Let my character reflect Christ. I look unto Jesus, the author and finisher of my faith, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
