  <strong>BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Matthew 5:9</strong><br>
  “Blessed are the peacemakers:
  for they shall be called
  the children of God.”<br><br>

  A peacemaker is not merely
  someone who avoids trouble.
  A peacemaker is one
  who brings <em>shalom</em>,
  God’s wholeness,
  healing,
  and reconciliation
  into places of brokenness.<br><br>

  Peacemakers step into the gap
  between arguments,
  between friends who no longer speak,
  and even into their own angry thoughts.
  They choose the hard work
  of restoring calm,
  truth,
  and love.<br><br>

  The world produces troublemakers,
  but God raises peacemakers.
  And Jesus calls them blessed.
  Why?
  Because when you make peace,
  you reflect the nature of your Father.<br><br>

  God Himself is the ultimate peacemaker.
  He sent Jesus
  to make peace
  between humanity and Himself.
  When you forgive,
  reconcile,
  or calm a quarrel,
  you are acting like God.
  That is why peacemakers
  are called the children of God,
  they carry the family resemblance.<br><br>

  <strong>Colossians 1:20</strong><br>
  “And, having made peace
  through the blood of his cross,
  by him to reconcile all things unto himself.”<br><br>

  This blessing is not for those
  who run away from conflict.
  It is for those
  who courageously allow God’s healing
  to flow through them
  in the middle of conflict.
  It may be in your home,
  in your workplace,
  or within your own heart.<br><br>

  Today,
  ask God to show you
  one place where you can be a peacemaker.
  Speak kind words.
  Let go of a grudge.
  Refuse to pass on gossip.
  In that moment,
  you are not just keeping peace,
  you are creating it.
  And heaven recognizes you
  as its own.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  endue me with the grace
  to make peace everywhere I go.
  Let my life reflect Your nature,
  in Jesus’ name.
  Amen.

  <strong>LORD, MAKE MY LIFE MEANINGFUL</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Genesis 45:13</strong><br>
  “And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt,
  and of all that ye have seen;
  and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.”<br><br>

  A man of God once taught
  that when a life lacks meaning,
  men will despise it
  and take it for granted.
  But when a life carries meaning,
  glorious things
  will be spoken of it.
  This truth is clearly seen
  in the life of Joseph.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 87:3</strong><br>
  “Glorious things are spoken of thee,
  O city of God.”<br><br>

  From birth,
  God marked Joseph’s life
  as meaningful.
  His dreams were great,
  but his journey was hard.
  His brothers hated him,
  sold him,
  and lied against him.
  He became a slave,
  then a prisoner.
  Yet, at every stage,
  God was with him.<br><br>

  The same gift
  that made his brothers jealous
  was the same gift
  that brought him before Pharaoh.
  A day came,
  just as God had spoken,
  when Joseph was lifted high.
  He told his brothers,
  <em>“Go and tell my father
  of all my glory.”</em>
  His life became so meaningful
  that nations were preserved
  and his family was restored.
  The same brothers
  who once despised him
  later bowed before him.<br><br>

  Your life may seem small right now.

  <strong>THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Romans 1:17</strong><br>
  “For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith:
  as it is written,
  The just shall live by faith.”<br><br>

  Faith is the currency
  of God’s kingdom.
  Just as money is required
  to transact in the natural,
  faith is required
  to receive in the spiritual.
  Faith is not a one-time experience;
  it is a daily necessity.
  God’s design is that you move
  from faith to faith,
  from one level of trust
  to another,
  from victory
  to greater victory.<br><br>

  Consider the woman
  with the issue of blood.
  She did not merely hope;
  she acted on what she believed.
  She pressed through the crowd
  with a faith so strong
  that it drew power
  from Jesus.
  And he said to her,
  <em>“Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole.”</em>
  <strong>Mark 5:34</strong><br><br>

  Faith is the bridge
  between your desire
  and God’s power
  to bring it to pass.
  When your faith is strong,
  you overcome temptations,
  challenges,
  and every obstacle
  that rises against you.<br><br>

  Faith, however,
  is not automatic.
  It can grow,
  and it can fail.
  That is why Jesus said to Peter,
  <em>“I have prayed for thee,
  that thy faith fail not.”</em>
  <strong>Luke 22:32</strong><br><br>

  Faith must be guarded.
  It grows by what you hear,
  what you meditate on,
  and what you allow
  into your heart.<br><br>

  <strong>Romans 10:17</strong><br>
  “So then faith cometh by hearing,
  and hearing by the word of God.”<br><br>

  If you do not guide
  what you hear,
  fear and doubt
  will weaken your faith.
  Feed your faith daily
  with God’s Word,
  and starve it
  of negative reports
  and unbelief.<br><br>

  In this year 2026,
  choose to live by faith
  and not by sight.
  Do not allow your past,
  your circumstances,
  or human opinions
  to define your reality.
  Let God’s Word
  shape your life.<br><br>

  Faith is the evidence
  of what you cannot yet see.
  It is your spiritual breath.
  Without faith,
  you cannot please God;
  but with faith,
  mountains move
  and doors open.
  A life of faith
  is a life of continual access
  to God’s goodness.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God,
  I declare that my faith
  will not fail.
  I choose to live by faith,
  trusting your Word
  in every situation.
  Let my life give you glory
  in this year 2026,
  in Jesus’ Name,
  Amen.
