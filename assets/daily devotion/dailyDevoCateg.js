<strong>OH LORD GIVE ME A NEW SONG</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 40:3</strong><br>
“And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.”<br><br>

Before a breakthrough appears publicly, Heaven often shifts something internally. Hope rises, and the burdens that once felt heavy begin to feel lighter—this is the beginning of a new song. A new song is not just about music; it is about testimony. It is the spiritual evidence that God has moved on your behalf.<br><br>

When God lifts you from the pit of despair, He places a new sound within you. He becomes your song, your strength, and your salvation. When God does a new thing, your declaration changes to: “The Lord has done it; my season has changed; mercy has spoken for me and my family.” Often, you don’t even realize the song has changed until you look back and see that you survived what was meant to destroy you.<br><br>

Beloved, you may still be in the middle of your story, but do not worry. The God who gave Hannah a song of triumph will give you yours as well. The God who turned David’s mourning into dancing remains the same today. To everyone who is tired: a new song is coming to you very soon in the name of the Lord.<br><br>

When God finishes what He has started in your life, people will hear of it and declare with you that this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, give me a new song; turn my mourning into dancing in Jesus’ name. Amen.

<strong>THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD IS STRETCHED OUT STILL</strong><br><br>

<strong>Isaiah 9:12</strong><br>
“For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.”<br><br>

The right hand of God speaks of His power, His authority, and His ability to save, deliver, and judge (<strong>Psalm 118:16</strong>). When the scripture says, “His hand is stretched out still,” it means God has not withdrawn His power; He has not folded His hands. His divine ability remains active on behalf of His children.<br><br>

Even when God corrected Israel for their sins, His hand remained stretched out. This is because God’s stretched-out hand is not only for judgment; it is also for mercy. It was His right hand that parted the Red Sea, defeated mighty enemies, and lifted Peter when he began to sink in the storm. Today, that same hand is stretched out toward you to save and restore you.<br><br>

You may feel forgotten, delayed, or unworthy, but God’s hand is still reaching for you. If you are in sin, His hand calls you to repentance; if you are weak, it offers strength; and if you are tired, it offers rest. The same hand that created the heavens is reaching toward you—do not run away from it, but rather run to it.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, I thank You because Your right hand is stretched out still. Stretch it towards me in mercy; lift me where I have fallen and strengthen me in Jesus' name. Amen.

<strong>HELP FROM EVERY DIRECTION</strong><br><br>

<strong>Genesis 13:14–15</strong><br>
“And the LORD said unto Abram... Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.”<br><br>

When God wanted to bless Abraham, He told him to look in every direction: north, south, east, and west. This instruction was a prophetic symbol that God’s help, blessing, and favor can come from every direction of life. God does not run out of channels to lift a man; He can raise a helper from any corner of the earth.<br><br>

Scripture shows us that God often works through men to help men. Though He is sovereign, He delights in using human vessels to execute His will. Just as Aaron and Hur supported Moses, Joseph preserved nations, and Barnabas strengthened Paul, God’s help often wears a human face.<br><br>

The Bible speaks of four major directions and describes gates on each side of the city of God (<strong>Ezekiel 48:30–35</strong>; <strong>Revelation 21:12–13</strong>). This signifies that from every direction, there are open gates of help, favor, and destiny. You may not know where your help will come from, but God does.<br><br>

The same God who sent angels to Abraham, ravens to Elijah, and wise men to Jesus can stir hearts from every corner of the earth to favor you. Trust Him to open the gates of help from places you least expect.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYERS</strong><br>
My Father, My God, open to me and my family the four gates, and let helpers and Your blessings flow to us, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
</p>
