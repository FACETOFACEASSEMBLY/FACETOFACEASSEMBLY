<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>


<strong>HELP FROM EVERY DIRECTION</strong><br><br>

<strong>Genesis 13:14–15</strong><br>
“And the LORD said unto Abram... Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.”<br><br>

When God wanted to bless Abraham, He told him to look in every direction: north, south, east, and west. This instruction was a prophetic symbol that God’s help, blessing, and favor can come from every corner of life. God never runs out of channels to lift a man; He can raise a helper from any part of the earth.<br><br>

Though God is sovereign and all-powerful, He delights in using human vessels to execute His will. We see this throughout scripture: Aaron and Hur helped Moses when his hands grew weak, Joseph preserved nations, and Barnabas was sent to strengthen Paul. Truly, God’s help often wears a human face.<br><br>

The Bible describes open gates on every side of the city of God—north, south, east, and west (<strong>Ezekiel 48:30–35</strong>; <strong>Revelation 21:12–13</strong>). This means that from every direction, there are open gates of help, favor, and destiny available to you. You may not know exactly where your breakthrough will come from, but God does.<br><br>

The same God who sent ravens to Elijah and wise men to Jesus can stir hearts from the least expected places to favor you. Trust that He is moving across every direction of the earth to bring your help to you in this season.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYERS</strong><br>
My Father, My God, open to me and my family the four gates, and let helpers and Your blessings flow to us from every direction, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>WHEN YOUR WAY PLEASES GOD</strong><br><br>

<strong>Proverbs 16:7</strong><br>
“When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.”<br><br>

This passage teaches us that when our lives are pleasing to God, He does wonderful things on our behalf. One of those blessings is divine peace—He takes those who are our enemies and causes them to be at peace with us. This doesn't mean that enemies cease to exist, but rather that God restrains them. Even if they still harbor ill will, they are compelled to choose peace over conflict and destruction.<br><br>

Pleasing God is the key to increasing "more and more" in every area of life (<strong>1 Thessalonians 4:1</strong>). If you desire to seek and find God, you must also strive to please Him. We please the Father through our giving, our prayer life, fasting, and a commitment to doing His will. As we align our walk with His desires, our path shines brighter and brighter.<br><br>

In <strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>, we are commanded to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. When this becomes our primary focus, all the "things" we need are added unto us. Prioritize God's pleasure, and He will handle your battles and your provisions.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYERS</strong><br>
My Father my God, cause me to please You in the name of Jesus.<br>
My Father my God, increase me more and more in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>



<strong>GOD’S LOVE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Romans 5:8</strong><br>
“But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”<br><br>

God’s love is not ordinary love. It is not based on feelings, performance, or what we deserve. The Bible reveals that Christ died for us while we were yet sinners; He loved us before we changed, before we repented, and even at our worst. This is the definition of real love.<br><br>

While human love often depends on being pleased or treated well, God’s love reached out to us even when we were far from Him. In <strong>Jeremiah 31:3</strong>, He declares, “I have loved thee with an everlasting love.” Everlasting means it never ends, never grows weak, and never changes with time. Though friends and people may fail or disappoint you, God’s love remains constant.<br><br>

The ultimate proof of this love is found in <strong>John 3:16</strong>—the sacrifice of His only begotten Son. The cross is the eternal evidence of your value. When you truly understand God’s love, you stop begging for acceptance and move away from living in fear or doubting your worth.<br><br>

God’s love provides you with security, identity, and peace—not because you are perfect, but because He is love (<strong>1 John 4:16</strong>). Rest in the assurance that you are cherished by the Almighty today.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, Thank You for loving me with an everlasting love. Help me to rest in Your love daily in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
