<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

<strong>EVIDENCE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Revelation 12:10</strong><br>
“For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.”<br><br>

Evidence is a testimony, material, or object used to prove a point. In <strong>Genesis 39</strong>, when Joseph fled from Potiphar’s wife to maintain his integrity, he left his garment behind. That garment became false evidence used to put an innocent man in prison. Even though Joseph was blameless, the evidence in her hand spoke against him.<br><br>

We see a different outcome in <strong>Luke 22:49–51</strong>. When Peter cut off the ear of the high priest's servant, that ear on the ground was evidence that could have sent Peter to prison. However, Jesus touched the man and healed him. By doing so, Jesus removed the evidence and saved Peter from the consequences of his actions.<br><br>

Beloved, the devil is an accuser who uses past mistakes, sins, and failures as evidence against us day and night. But we have a greater Advocate in Jesus Christ. When Jesus steps in with mercy, accusation loses its power. Just as He restored the servant's ear, He can destroy every record of failure or object of accusation that the enemy holds against you.<br><br>

Today, ask the Lord to wipe away every proof of sin and every record of failure speaking against your destiny. When Jesus heals and forgives, the negative evidence is destroyed forever.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, by the power in the blood of Jesus, I cancel every evidence against me and my household in Jesus' Name. Amen.

<strong>THE VOICE IN MY BLOODLINE</strong><br><br>

<strong>Ezekiel 18:20</strong><br>
“The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.”<br><br>

Every one of us comes from a family, and none of us appeared on earth without a bloodline. In every bloodline, there is a voice speaking—it can be good or evil, speaking blessings or trouble. The Bible shows that both wickedness and righteousness have a voice that can influence a lineage.<br><br>

In <strong>Matthew 22:25–27</strong>, Jesus spoke about a family where death and barrenness repeated themselves from the first brother even unto the seventh. This illustrates how negative patterns can travel through a bloodline when they are not confronted. As <strong>Lamentations 5:7</strong> says, "Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities."<br><br>

To stop these patterns, you must take spiritual action:<br>
1. Silence the voice of darkness (<strong>1 Samuel 2:9</strong>).<br>
2. Call on the name of the Lord for deliverance (<strong>Joel 2:32</strong>).<br>
3. Invoke the superior voice of the Blood of Jesus.<br><br>

I pray for you: may the Lord separate you from every evil voice speaking against your life. May the voice of righteousness speak louder than every voice of wickedness in your bloodline in Jesus’ name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, I silence every evil voice speaking in my bloodline in Jesus' Name. Amen.

<strong>TAKE IT BACK</strong><br><br>

<strong>John 10:18</strong><br>
“No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.”<br><br>

This verse shows us something amazing about Jesus. When He died, it looked like His life was taken by soldiers and enemies, but Jesus revealed that no one was strong enough to take it from Him. He chose to give His life, and even more, He had the power to take it back again. That is the power of resurrection.<br><br>

This same power is for you today. The devil often tries to steal our peace, health, joy, or blessings. Sometimes it feels like he has won, but the story of Jesus tells a different story. Because Jesus has the power to take His life back, we also have the power in His name to take back what the enemy has stolen.<br><br>

Think about David at Ziklag. The enemy had burned his home and taken his family and belongings. It looked like a total loss, but David did not give up. He asked God what to do, and God told him to pursue and recover all. David went and took back everything that was stolen. <strong>1 Samuel 30:1–8</strong><br><br>

This shows that with God, a loss is not the end. You are not powerless; Jesus has given you His authority. You don't have to accept what the enemy has stolen. You can pray, stand, and declare in faith that you are taking it back. Your joy, health, family, and destiny are being recovered now in Jesus’ name.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My GOD, by the power of Jesus, I take back everything the enemy has stolen from my life. I recover my peace, my health, my joy, and my blessings. I declare restoration now, in Jesus’ name. Amen.
