<p><strong>WAIT FOR IT</strong><br><br>

Life is a journey of faith and patience.<br><br>

<strong>“That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” — Hebrews 6:12</strong><br><br>

There is a phase in every believer’s life called the waiting season — a moment where results have not yet appeared, prayers seem unanswered, and silence feels louder than confirmation.<br><br>

This is the place between <em>“IT SHALL COME TO PASS”</em> and <em>“IT HAS COME TO PASS.”</em><br><br>

In this sacred space, God builds your character, strengthens your faith, and prepares you for the manifestation of His promise.<br><br>

Abraham understood this mystery and <strong>“staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.” — Romans 4:20</strong><br><br>

Even when nothing seemed to be happening, he chose worship over worry.<br><br>

And God reminds us again:<br>
<strong>“For the vision is yet for an appointed time; but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.” — Habakkuk 2:3</strong><br><br>

Waiting is not a delay — it is divine preparation, alignment, and growth.<br><br>

Job understood this deeply when he declared,<br>
<strong>“All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.” — Job 14:14</strong><br><br>

While you wait, keep thanking God.  
He who began the good work will surely complete it.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, let my change come speedily in the name of Jesus. Amen.</p>

    prayer: `<p><strong>WHY PEOPLE LABOUR IN VAIN</strong><br><br>

There is a painful mystery many people experience yet rarely understand —  
to work hard and see no results,  
to plant much yet harvest little,  
to build with effort yet watch it crumble.  
Scripture calls this labouring in vain.<br><br>

The Bible reveals a powerful truth:  
Labour alone does not guarantee success;  
only God’s blessing does.  
Without Him, human effort collapses.  
With Him, even the smallest effort multiplies.<br><br>

When Simon Peter fished all night and caught nothing, it was not because he lacked skill —  
it was because God’s hand had not yet rested on the work.  
<strong>(Luke 5:3–5)</strong><br><br>

<strong>REASONS PEOPLE LABOUR IN VAIN</strong><br><br>

<strong>1. When God Is Not the Foundation — Psalm 127:1</strong><br>
“Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it…”  
You may build a business, a marriage, a ministry, or a career,  
but if God is not the Builder, it will eventually fall.<br><br>

<strong>2. When Labour Falls Under a Curse — Deuteronomy 28:41</strong><br>
“Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them…”  
Disobedience disconnects a person from divine blessing  
and makes their labour unfruitful.  
Without alignment with God, effort produces frustration, not results.<br><br>

<strong>3. When a Person Is Wicked — Job 9:29</strong><br>
“If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?”  
Job is saying, “If God sees me as wicked, then my labour cannot produce results.”  
Hidden sin, wickedness, or living outside God’s will  
shuts the doors of fruitfulness.<br><br>

Only covenant people enjoy lasting, permanent fruitfulness.<br><br>

<strong>Isaiah 65:23</strong><br>
“They shall not labour in vain… for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD.”  
This shall be your portion in Jesus’ Name. Amen.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
My Father, my God, align my life with Your will.  
I reject wickedness, error, and disobedience.  
I decree that I shall not labour in vain.  
In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>`

LIFE OF IMPACT

A life of impact is not measured by how long you live, but by how much light you leave behind. There is a weight your life is meant to carry — the weight of relevance, influence, and divine significance. God never created His children to pass through the earth unnoticed. You were designed to matter, to shine, to lift, and to leave footprints of grace wherever you walk.

When God called Abraham, His first promise was not riches, land, or possessions — it was impact.

“I will bless you… and you shall be a blessing.” — Genesis 12:2

God was not simply promising abundance; He was promising influence. He was saying, “My blessing will not end with you — it will flow through you.” The evidence of divine blessing is not what you accumulate, but what you distribute.

Not what you gather, but what you give. Not what you store, but what you sow.

Psalm 72:17 makes a powerful declaration: “His name shall endure forever… and men shall be blessed in him.”

A man who walks with God does not fade with time — his influence becomes timeless. Impact is when your presence becomes a doorway for blessing, and your absence still carries your signature. It is when people encounter God’s goodness through your life without you needing applause or noise.

And Scripture says:
“Blessed is he that considers the poor…” — Psalm 41:1

A life of impact sees beyond itself. It looks for broken people to lift, hurting hearts to heal, and weary hands to strengthen. God calls such a person “blessed”—not because he owns everything, but because he uses what he has to make others rise.

To live a life of impact is to become an extension of God’s kindness. It is to become a vessel through which heaven touches humanity. The more you give, the more God multiplies. The more you serve, the more God elevates. The more you lift others, the more God lifts you. (Acts 9:36–39)

Impact is not popularity. Impact is not noise. Impact is not applause. Impact is when someone silently thanks God because you exist.

This is the life God designed for you — a life that blesses, lifts, strengthens, and shines.

PRAYER:
My Father, my God, make my life a channel of blessing. Let Your grace flow through me to the nations. Use me as an extension of Your kindness on the earth. Make my life a testimony of Your goodness. In Jesus’ name, Amen.`
