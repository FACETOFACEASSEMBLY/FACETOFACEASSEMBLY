    prayer: `<p>ALWAYS GIVE THANKS TO GOD  

“One major reason God created us is for us to praise Him always, no matter the circumstances.” — Isaiah 43:21-22  

“These people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.”  

When Jesus faced scarcity, He didn’t first pray for supply — He gave thanks. Instantly, divine provision multiplied the five loaves and two fishes until twelve baskets overflowed (John 6:10-14). Gratitude opened the door to abundance.  

If the Son of God could give thanks before the miracle, how much more should we? In Luke 17:15-17, only one out of ten lepers returned to give thanks — and he alone was made whole. Thanksgiving completes your miracle.  

Even at Lazarus’ tomb, Jesus gave thanks (John 11:41-44), and life returned to what was dead. Whatever looks finished — your job, health, or peace — can rise again through thanksgiving.  

Beloved, gratitude is not optional; it is the key that unlocks God’s presence and power. Give thanks always, and you will see His mighty hand at work in your life.  

<br><br>
PRAYER: <br>
My Father, my God, give me the grace to thank You always, especially in situations that compel complaints. In Jesus’ Name. Amen.
</p>

    prayer: `<p>ESCAPE FROM DEATH BELONGS TO GOD  

“Our God is a God of salvation, and escape from death belongs to the Lord GOD.” — Psalm 68:20  

Every breath you take is proof that God alone has authority over life and death. No one escapes death by their own strength—it is the Lord who grants deliverance when destruction draws near.  

When Israel stood before the Red Sea, God made a way. When Daniel was cast into the lions’ den, God shut their mouths. When Peter awaited execution, God sent an angel to free him. Each escape was divine mercy, not luck.  

So, do not fear what men can do. The keys of life and death are in God’s hands. Walk in obedience and dwell in His presence, for your preservation is in Him. Every narrow escape is His reminder: “Your life is in My hands.”  

<br>
<br>
PRAYER: <br>
My Father, my God, I thank You because You are the God of my salvation. Thank You for every time You have delivered me from death and danger. I trust You completely to keep me safe and preserve my life according to Your will. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>`

    prayer: `<p>WHEN THE PAST SPEAKS IN THE FUTURE 

“That thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.” — Job 13:26

Esau exchanged his birthright for a single meal, and later when he desired the blessing, it was no longer his. His past mistake stood before him in the future and spoke against him.  

Many today suffer not because of what they do now, but because of what they did yesterday—wrong choices, careless words, or ungodly decisions. Job said the iniquities of his youth rose to confront him later in life.  

Beloved, may your past mistakes not wait for you in the future. The blood of Jesus still speaks—better things than judgment. It speaks mercy, forgiveness, restoration, and peace. Take your past to Him, and every voice of error will be silenced.  

<br>
<br>
PRAYER: <br>
The blood of Jesus speaks better things for me. My past is forgiven, my present is redeemed, and my future is secured in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>`
