  <strong>KEEP BELIEVING</strong><br><br>

  There is a divine principle in the Kingdom: what hell has assigned to be permanent,
  God ordains to be temporary.<br>
  <em>“While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen:
  for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.”</em>
  — 2 Corinthians 4:18<br><br>

  Joseph understood this principle. He was betrayed, enslaved, and imprisoned for crimes
  he did not commit. He carried a God-given dream inside a man-made dungeon.
  His circumstances shouted “life sentence,” but heaven had already written
  “Prime Minister.”<br><br>

  <em>“Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon:
  and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.”</em>
  — Genesis 41:14<br><br>

  The prison is not just a place.<br>
  It is an assignment of delay.<br>
  It is a plot to bury a promise.<br>
  It is a system designed to make a man forget his destiny.<br><br>

  But throughout Scripture, God consistently rises to reverse the plots of the enemy.
  In Joseph’s life, when the enemy used the pit, slavery, and prison to destroy a dream,
  God used that same prison as the pathway to the palace.
  The place meant to break him became the platform that launched him.<br><br>

  <em>“And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this,
  there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
  Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled:
  only in the throne will I be greater than thou.”</em>
  — Genesis 41:39–40<br><br>

  Your delay may appear long, but it has an expiry date on God’s calendar.
  And God’s promotion always includes the authority to govern what once held you captive.
  God never brings you out without setting you over.<br><br>

  You are not stuck — you are in processing.
  The “hastily” of God can compress years of waiting into a single day
  of supernatural reversal.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, every prison assigned against my destiny must release me now.
  Let Your purpose for my life be established.
  I step out of delay and into divine fulfillment.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>POWER OF UNDERSTANDING</strong><br><br>

  Understanding is life. Understanding is power. Understanding is light. Scripture says,
  “Give me understanding, and I shall live” (Psalm 119:144).
  God has no business with those who lack understanding. It is understanding that
  produces the hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold manifestations. No one succeeds in
  any field or calling until they gain understanding in it.<br><br>

  Everyone who walked with God in Scripture was a person of understanding—whether Moses,
  Daniel, or Apostle Paul. Their understanding positioned them to manifest the plan of God.<br><br>

  In Acts 8:30–31, Philip met a man reading the prophet Isaiah and asked,
  “Understandest thou what thou readest?” The man replied,
  “How can I, except some man should guide me?” This shows that
  <strong>everyone needs a guide to bring understanding.</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Ways You Can Gain Understanding:</strong><br>
  1. Study to show yourself approved (2 Timothy 2:15).<br>
  2. Follow men who have successfully gone ahead of you (2 Corinthians 8:15).<br>
  3. Ask questions—“Stand in the ways and ask…” (Jeremiah 6:16).<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, let the spirit of understanding come afresh upon me. Amen.<br><br>

  GOD BLESS YOU!

  <strong>THE POWER OF PRAYER</strong><br><br>

  Prayer is a weapon every believer can use to overcome the enemy. Until you pray, God will not move on your behalf. When the enemy captures your prayer life, he has captured your destiny. This is why you must guard your prayer life with vigilance and spiritual sensitivity.<br><br>

  <strong>Acts 12:1–5</strong><br>
  “Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.”<br><br>

  Herod continued killing the apostles until the church awakened to prayer. The slaughter did not stop until prayer began. It is prayer that halts demonic operations, stops wickedness, and brings the works of the enemy to an end.<br><br>

  <strong>Mark 1:35</strong><br>
  “And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.”<br><br>

  Jesus Christ—our perfect example—spent more time in prayer than He did with people. He understood that wickedness increases daily on the earth, and only a man of prayer can subdue it. If you must stop the works of darkness, you must become prayerful. Without a consistent prayer life, the enemy will gain advantage over you.<br><br>

  <strong>Mark 1:37</strong><br>
  “And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.”<br><br>

  After Jesus prayed, men began to seek Him. If your business is not growing, if opportunities seem scarce, it may be that your prayer altar is weak. Prayer puts an excellent spirit upon your work, your business, and your life (Daniel 6:3). It draws favour, influence, and divine attention. Every end-time believer must be committed to prayer to prevail and prosper.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, My God, revive my prayer life in the Name of Jesus. Set my spirit on fire, restore my hunger for Your presence, and strengthen me to watch and pray always. Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>GOD BLESS YOU</strong>
