<p> <strong>EVERY MAN HAS GLORY, MANIFEST IT</strong><br><br>

“This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth His glory; and His disciples believed on Him.”<br>
<em>— John 2:11</em><br><br>

Every man born of God carries a measure of heavenly glory. You did not arrive on earth empty. You came loaded with a divine deposit, a uniqueness placed inside you by God Himself. Scripture says that God crowned man with glory and honour, meaning there is a weight of divine identity resting on your life.<br><br>

When Jesus performed His first miracle in Cana, the Bible states that He “manifested HIS glory.” Take note — He did not manifest another man’s glory. He did not borrow another destiny. He did not function with the light of another star.<br><br>

He manifested His own.<br><br>

There is a glory that is uniquely yours. A light only you carry. A sound, a grace, a star, a destiny that belongs exclusively to you. No one else can shine your shine. No one else can take your space. No one else can sit on your God-ordained throne.<br><br>

Your glory is Heaven’s signature on your life. It is the expression of your relevance on earth. Others may inspire you, but no one can replace the glory God has placed upon you.<br><br>

This is why you must never admire others to the point of abandoning yourself. And never believe the lie that your life lacks meaning. If God sent you here, He sent you with glory. Creation is waiting for the manifestation of what you carry.<br><br>

Anyone who attempts to steal or manifest your glory is trying to rewrite God’s design — and they will fail. Your glory is yours alone, and it must be revealed.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, help me to manifest the glory You placed within me — boldly, fully, and without fear. I rise to shine in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

  <strong>OH LORD, LET THE WICKEDNESS OF THE WICKED COME TO AN END</strong><br><br>

  There is a divine justice system woven into the foundations of God’s kingdom. Scripture shows us that wickedness is never permitted to continue unchecked. There is a point where the mercy of God steps aside, and His righteous judgment steps in.<br><br>

  David understood this mystery. Surrounded by enemies whose hearts were hardened against righteousness, he cried not for revenge, but for alignment with God’s divine order.<br><br>

  “Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.”<br>
  <em>— Psalm 7:9</em><br><br>

  The wickedness of the wicked is not just an act — it is a system, a pattern, a destructive cycle that seeks to ruin destinies, families, and purposes.<br><br>

  Yet throughout Scripture, God rises to interrupt wicked cycles. In the days of Mordecai and Esther, when Haman crafted evil, the Lord overturned the device of the wicked.<br><br>

  “So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.”<br>
  <em>— Esther 7:10</em><br><br>

  Wickedness may appear strong, but it has an expiry date in God’s calendar. And divine justice never destroys wickedness without uplifting righteousness in its place.<br><br>

  “For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.”<br>
  <em>— Psalm 37:17</em><br><br>

  When you pray, “Oh Lord, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,” you are declaring a verdict already written in heaven.<br><br>

  <em>Proverbs 4:14–16</em><br>
  14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.<br>
  15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.<br>
  16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.<br><br>

  Hear this today: the wickedness of the wicked must come to an end, and the righteousness of the righteous must be established.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  Oh Lord, let every form of wickedness assigned against my life come to an end. Establish Your righteousness in me, around me, and through me. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.<br><br>

    prayer: `<strong>A THREEFOLD CORD</strong><br><br>

  There is a divine pattern hidden in the principle of “three times.” In Scripture, consistent spiritual actions repeated three times often carry prophetic weight and power.<br><br>

  When Jesus faced the weight of the cross, He prayed three times about the same matter. This was not mere repetition; it was persistence in surrender. And after the third time, He said, “Not my will, but Thine be done.”<br>
  <em>— Matthew 26:44</em><br><br>

  Daniel also followed this ancient pattern. Even in the face of persecution, he remained unshaken, praying three times a day with his windows open toward Jerusalem.<br>
  <em>— Daniel 6:10</em><br><br>

  The Psalmist echoed the same rhythm of devotion: evening, morning, and noon — a complete cycle of spiritual discipline.<br>
  <em>— Psalm 55:17</em><br><br>

  Why three times? Because heaven recognizes “three” as a complete witness — a divine confirmation.<br>
  <em>— 2 Corinthians 13:1</em><br><br>

  Even creation itself mirrors this divine pattern: Heaven, Earth, and Under the Earth — all bowing to the name of Jesus.<br>
  <em>— Philippians 2:10</em><br><br>

  And when you face a pressing issue, Scripture shows another mystery: agreement. Find two people who will stand with you in faith, for a threefold cord cannot be easily broken.<br>
  <em>— Ecclesiastes 4:12</em><br><br>

  There is power in spiritual consistency. Whatever area you desire to see results — prayer, fasting, giving, declarations — commit to it three times, and watch heaven respond with power.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  Father, strengthen my commitment to spiritual consistency. Help me to build a threefold cord of discipline, faith, and agreement, and let heaven respond to my persistence. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.
