<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>

<strong>WEDNESDAY 18TH FEBRUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD IS STRETCHED OUT STILL</strong><br><br>

<strong>Isaiah 9:12</strong><br>
“For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.”<br><br>

The right hand of God speaks of His power, His authority, and His ability to save, deliver, and judge (<strong>Psalm 118:16</strong>). When the scripture says, “His hand is stretched out still,” it means God has not withdrawn His power; He has not folded His hands. His divine ability remains active on behalf of His children.<br><br>

Even when God corrected Israel for their sins, His hand remained stretched out. This is because God’s stretched-out hand is not only for judgment; it is also for mercy. It was His right hand that parted the Red Sea, defeated mighty enemies, and lifted Peter when he began to sink in the storm. Today, that same hand is stretched out toward you to save and restore you.<br><br>

You may feel forgotten, delayed, or unworthy, but God’s hand is still reaching for you. If you are in sin, His hand calls you to repentance; if you are weak, it offers strength; and if you are tired, it offers rest. The same hand that created the heavens is reaching toward you—do not run away from it, but rather run to it.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, I thank You because Your right hand is stretched out still. Stretch it towards me in mercy; lift me where I have fallen and strengthen me in Jesus' name. Amen.

<strong>HELP FROM EVERY DIRECTION</strong><br><br>

<strong>Genesis 13:14–15</strong><br>
“And the LORD said unto Abram... Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.”<br><br>

When God wanted to bless Abraham, He told him to look in every direction: north, south, east, and west. This instruction was a prophetic symbol that God’s help, blessing, and favor can come from every direction of life. God does not run out of channels to lift a man; He can raise a helper from any corner of the earth.<br><br>

Scripture shows us that God often works through men to help men. Though He is sovereign, He delights in using human vessels to execute His will. Just as Aaron and Hur supported Moses, Joseph preserved nations, and Barnabas strengthened Paul, God’s help often wears a human face.<br><br>

The Bible speaks of four major directions and describes gates on each side of the city of God (<strong>Ezekiel 48:30–35</strong>; <strong>Revelation 21:12–13</strong>). This signifies that from every direction, there are open gates of help, favor, and destiny. You may not know where your help will come from, but God does.<br><br>

The same God who sent angels to Abraham, ravens to Elijah, and wise men to Jesus can stir hearts from every corner of the earth to favor you. Trust Him to open the gates of help from places you least expect.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYERS</strong><br>
My Father, My God, open to me and my family the four gates, and let helpers and Your blessings flow to us, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

This instruction was a prophetic symbol that God’s help, blessing, and favor can come from every corner of life. God never runs out of channels to lift a man; He can raise a helper from any part of the earth.<br><br>

Though God is sovereign and all-powerful, He delights in using human vessels to execute His will. We see this throughout scripture: Aaron and Hur helped Moses when his hands grew weak, Joseph preserved nations, and Barnabas was sent to strengthen Paul. Truly, God’s help often wears a human face.<br><br>

The Bible describes open gates on every side of the city of God—north, south, east, and west (<strong>Ezekiel 48:30–35</strong>; <strong>Revelation 21:12–13</strong>). This means that from every direction, there are open gates of help, favor, and destiny available to you. You may not know exactly where your breakthrough will come from, but God does.<br><br>

The same God who sent ravens to Elijah and wise men to Jesus can stir hearts from the least expected places to favor you. Trust that He is moving across every direction of the earth to bring your help to you in this season.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYERS</strong><br>
My Father, My God, open to me and my family the four gates, and let helpers and Your blessings flow to us from every direction, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
