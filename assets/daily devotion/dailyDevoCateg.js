<p> <strong>WELCOME TO DECEMBER: THE LORD SHALL BE YOUR EVERLASTING LIGHT</strong><br><br>

Isaiah 60:19
"The sun shall be no more your light by day, neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto you: but the LORD shall be unto you an everlasting light, and your God your glory."

As we enter this sacred month, God's word delivers a promise that transcends the changing seasons. In Isaiah, the Lord declares a profound shift from natural, temporary illumination to divine, eternal radiance. You were not designed to depend on earthly sources of light.  The Lord himself appoints himself your Everlasting Light.

But how can we walk in this supernatural light in our daily lives? Psalm 27:1 provides the foundation for this promise: "The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?" This scripture confirms that the Everlasting Light is a present reality for every generation that puts its trust in Him. This promise was written for you this December, for this moment in your journey.

You may walk through personal nights of uncertainty, waiting, or grief. The year may be closing with shadows you did not anticipate. Yet these two scriptures dissolve all fear. Your Everlasting Light is also your salvation and your strength. Every step taken in faith, these are acts of walking in the Light that has no end. You are living proof that God's glory outshines every temporary darkness.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, as I enter this month, let me walk in the radiance of your everlasting light. Be my glory in every situation, and let my life reflect your unending dawn.

    prayer: `<p> <strong>CREATED FOR HIS PRAISE</strong><br><br>

“This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.”<br>
<em>— Isaiah 43:21</em><br><br>

There is a divine thread of purpose woven from eternity straight into your life. In Isaiah, God makes a profound declaration: you are a people shaped, fashioned, and intentionally designed by Him. You were not created accidentally or without direction. Your existence carries heavenly intention — you were formed for God Himself, to reveal His excellence, His character, and His glory.<br><br>

Your life is not random. It is a divine instrument meant to display His praise.<br><br>

How do we know this includes us today? Psalm 102 gives the assurance:<br><br>

“This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord.”<br>
<em>— Psalm 102:18</em><br><br>

This means you were seen, known, and included in God’s eternal plan long before you were born. You are part of a prophetic generation created for praise. Your very breath is proof of divine intention. Every moment of gratitude, every song of worship, every act of faith — these are the ways you “shew forth” the praise of the One who formed you.<br><br>

When you question your purpose or value, these scriptures remove all doubt: your highest calling is to reflect God’s worth. Everything about your life was designed to point back to Him.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, let my life continually bring glory to Your name. Amen.

    prayer: `<p> <strong>EVERY MAN HAS GLORY, MANIFEST IT</strong><br><br>

“This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth His glory; and His disciples believed on Him.”<br>
<em>— John 2:11</em><br><br>

Every man born of God carries a measure of heavenly glory. You did not arrive on earth empty. You came loaded with a divine deposit, a uniqueness placed inside you by God Himself. Scripture says that God crowned man with glory and honour, meaning there is a weight of divine identity resting on your life.<br><br>

When Jesus performed His first miracle in Cana, the Bible states that He “manifested HIS glory.” Take note — He did not manifest another man’s glory. He did not borrow another destiny. He did not function with the light of another star.<br><br>

He manifested His own.<br><br>

There is a glory that is uniquely yours. A light only you carry. A sound, a grace, a star, a destiny that belongs exclusively to you. No one else can shine your shine. No one else can take your space. No one else can sit on your God-ordained throne.<br><br>

Your glory is Heaven’s signature on your life. It is the expression of your relevance on earth. Others may inspire you, but no one can replace the glory God has placed upon you.<br><br>

This is why you must never admire others to the point of abandoning yourself. And never believe the lie that your life lacks meaning. If God sent you here, He sent you with glory. Creation is waiting for the manifestation of what you carry.<br><br>

Anyone who attempts to steal or manifest your glory is trying to rewrite God’s design — and they will fail. Your glory is yours alone, and it must be revealed.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, help me to manifest the glory You placed within me — boldly, fully, and without fear. I rise to shine in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
