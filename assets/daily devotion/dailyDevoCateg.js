  <strong>WHEN YOUR WAY PLEASES GOD</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Proverbs 16:7</strong><br>
  “When a man’s ways please the Lord,
  He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.”<br><br>

  This scripture reveals a powerful kingdom principle.
  When a man’s ways are pleasing to God,
  God Himself intervenes in his affairs.
  He takes those who rise as enemies
  and restrains their hands from warfare.
  This does not mean enemies will not exist,
  but it means they will choose peace
  instead of destruction and open conflict.<br><br>

  When God is pleased with your walk,
  He becomes your defender.
  Battles you should have fought
  are neutralized by divine authority.
  Opposition loses permission to advance against you.<br><br>

  <strong>1 Thessalonians 4:1</strong><br>
  “Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren,
  and exhort you by the Lord Jesus,
  that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk
  and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.”<br><br>

  Pleasing God is the pathway to increase.
  Scripture teaches that when God is pleased,
  a man abounds more and more.
  Growth, elevation, and preservation

  <strong>NO ONE WILL TURN MY GLORY TO SHAME</strong><br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 4:2</strong><br>
  “O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?
  how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing?”<br><br>

  Glory is God’s investment in a man. Shame is the enemy’s agenda
  against that investment. Many people do not lack destiny;
  they lack the preservation of glory. David’s cry in Psalm 4:2
  is not weakness—it is spiritual awareness. He understood that
  glory can be attacked, questioned, delayed, or mocked,
  but it must never be surrendered.<br><br>

  <strong>Psalm 8:5</strong><br>
  God crowned man with glory and honour. This means glory is
  not accidental; it is divine placement.<br><br>

  David speaks as one conscious of his divine positioning.
  He says, “my glory,” acknowledging ownership,
  yet confronting those attempting to convert it into shame.
  This reveals a powerful spiritual principle:
  glory attracts contention. When God marks a man with glory,
  opposition rises to disgrace it.<br><br>

  Shame is not always the result of sin; sometimes it is warfare.
  The enemy’s objective is not just to stop you,
  but to make your glory look like failure.
  The turning of glory to shame often comes through
  delays that resemble denial,
  mockery from those who once applauded,
  pressure to compromise identity for acceptance,
  and situations designed to make you doubt God’s Word.<br><br>

  But David understood a higher truth:
  men may attempt, but they cannot succeed without permission.
  No man has the authority to rewrite what God authored.
  If God called it glory, no situation has the power to rename it shame.<br><br>

  <strong>Job 29:20</strong><br>
  “My glory was fresh in me…”<br><br>

  I stand with God’s promise and declare
  that my glory shall remain fresh,
  preserved, and defended by God Himself.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, I declare that my glory shall not be turned
  to shame. Preserve what You have invested in me.
  Defend my destiny, silence mockery,
  and let my glory remain fresh by Your power.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.<br><br>

  <strong>THE MORE YOU STUDY, THE BETTER YOU BECOME</strong><br><br>

  Think of your faith like a house. A house needs a strong foundation and solid walls to
  stand firm. God’s Word is that foundation. When you neglect study, your spiritual life
  becomes vulnerable. Jesus warned that ignorance of Scripture and the power of God
  leads people into error.<br>
  <em>“Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.”</em>
  — Matthew 22:29<br><br>

  Studying the Bible is not only for pastors or teachers. It is essential for your daily
  life, your decisions, your growth, and your peace. A shallow Word produces a shaky
  faith, but deep study builds spiritual stability.<br><br>

  The best people in Scripture were always learning:<br><br>

  • The disciples did not only follow Jesus; they sat with Him, asked questions,
  and allowed Him to teach them how to live.<br><br>

  • Cornelius was a devout and praying man, yet he still needed understanding through
  Peter’s teaching (Acts 10).<br><br>

  • The Ethiopian official was reading the Scriptures, but understanding came only
  when Philip explained the Word to him (Acts 8:30–31).<br><br>

  • Even Jesus, as a child, was found in the temple listening, asking questions,
  and learning (Luke 2:46).<br><br>

  Here is the beautiful truth: what you learn is not meant to end with you.
  Jesus commanded us to teach others what we have been taught
  (Matthew 28:19–20). As long as you remain teachable, you remain useful in God’s hands.<br><br>

  Seek those who know the Word and learn from them.
  Study the Scriptures personally.
  Listen to sound teaching.
  And when understanding comes, be ready to share it with humility and love.
  This is how believers grow strong together.<br><br>

  <strong>PRAYER:</strong><br>
  My Father, my God, ignite in me a genuine hunger for Your Word.
  Open my understanding, strengthen my foundation,
  and help me grow through Your truth.
  In Jesus’ Name, Amen.<br><br>
