<strong>KINGDOM MYSTERIES DAILY DEVOTIONAL</strong><br>
<strong>BY TEACHER OF GOD’S WORD, HAPPY OVERAH</strong><br><br>

<strong>GOD IS FAITHFUL</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 37:25</strong><br>
“I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.”<br><br>

The faithfulness of God is a lifelong testimony. As the Psalmist observed over many years, God does not abandon the righteous or forget those who trust in Him. His faithfulness is not seasonal; it does not change with time, age, or shifting circumstances. From youth to old age, His hand remains sure upon His people.<br><br>

God has made a permanent commitment to you, declaring in <strong>Hebrews 13:5</strong>, “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.” His presence is not a suggestion but a promise. While people may fail and situations may shift, God remains righteous in all His ways. He cannot deny Himself, and He cannot fail His people.<br><br>

One profound expression of His faithfulness is how He sustains generations, ensuring that the seed of the righteous does not beg for bread. God is a keeper of generations; what He starts, He sustains. Even when you do not fully understand His process, you can always trust His character.<br><br>

Do not judge God by a single moment; judge Him by His settled Word. Hold on to His mercy and rest in His faithfulness. He has never failed, and He will not start failing with you.<br><br>

<strong>THANKSGIVING</strong><br>
My Father My God, I thank You for Your faithfulness. I am forever grateful. Amen.

<strong>WRITE THE VISION, IT MUST SPEAK</strong><br><br>

<strong>Habakkuk 2:2–3</strong><br>
“And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie.”<br><br>

Every vision that comes from God carries His power and is intended to guide you, not confuse you. When God instructs you to write the vision, He is encouraging you to hold onto His word even when the manifestation is not yet visible. A written vision keeps your faith alive during the seasons of waiting.<br><br>

The Bible promises that though the vision may seem slow, it must speak—it will surely come to pass at the appointed time. One way the vision speaks is by keeping your focus on God. <strong>Psalm 34:5</strong> tells us that those who look to Him are lightened and their faces are never covered with shame. Divine light removes fear and disappointment, replacing them with hope.<br><br>

Another way the vision speaks is through faith and patience (<strong>Hebrews 6:12</strong>). God’s timing is perfect; the vision is never late and it will not fail. Do not be distracted by people or circumstances. Keep your eyes fixed on God, and He will strengthen you and cause His promises to speak clearly in your life.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father, My God, my eyes are on You; lighten my face. I shall not see shame in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<strong>FRIDAY 6TH FEBRUARY 2026</strong><br><br>

<strong>IT IS TIME FOR GOD TO WORK</strong><br><br>

<strong>Psalm 119:126</strong><br>
“It is time for thee, LORD, to work.”<br><br>

Whenever God moves with His mighty hand, He is working, and the evidence of His labor is always visible. One primary way God works is by declaring light. From the beginning, His word has displaced darkness, bringing liberty, removing confusion, and breaking the chains of fear and bondage.<br><br>

Another way God works is by stretching forth His right hand. We see this in the life of Peter, who began to sink while walking on water. In his moment of fear, he didn't offer a long prayer; he simply cried, “Lord, save me.” Immediately, Jesus stretched forth His hand and rescued him. <strong>Matthew 14:29–31</strong>.<br><br>

The scripture reminds us in <strong>Isaiah 9:21</strong> that His hand is stretched out still. God’s hand is available for you today. All you need to do is cry out for His help and invite Him to work in your life. When you call upon Him to save you, you will experience an instant turnaround.<br><br>

<strong>PRAYER</strong><br>
My Father My God, it is time for You to work. Let Your light shine and let Your right hand, which is full of power, save me from drowning in Jesus' Name. Amen.
